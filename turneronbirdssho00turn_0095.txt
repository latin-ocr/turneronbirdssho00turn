in the nests of smaller birds, and it devours the eggs
of the others that it finds It mostly seeks the nests
of the Palumbes and eats those birds' eggs, leaving
its own behind. For the most part it lays a single
egg or rarely two. It also lays in the Curuca’s nest,
and that bird sits upon the eggS, hatches and rears
the young. And at that time indeed the offspring of
the Cuculus is both particularly fat and of a grateful
flavour. A certain kind of Cuculus is wont to make its
nest far off on steep and very lofty rocks.

Here Aristotle has portrayed the Cuculus to us most
gmphically, and, had he described the Curuca in the same
carcful way, it would not at this day have been so little
known to almost everyone as now it is. The Curuca of
Aristotle Ι suspect to be the Titling¹ of the English. For
I have observed no other bird in life more frequently than
this following the Cukkow's young and rearing it, as though
its own. Now it is less than the Luscinia, but with thc same
figure of body, and in colour somewhat green; it hunts for
gnats and little worms among the boughs of trees. It scldom
settles on the ground, and is not scen in winter.

OF THE CREX FROM AiusTOTLE.

But seeing that all birds have four toes each, three
are directed forwards and one backwards by way of
a heel, for safety¹s sake; the,last is very small in
such as have long legs, as happens with the Crex.
Further the Crex is of pugnacious habit, elever in
procuring food, but of bad omen otherwise.

There is a certain bird in England with long leg5‚ otherwise
like a Quail, except that it is bigger, which in spring as well
as early summer makes no other cry among the corn and flax

¹ It is impossible to say with certainty what Turner‘s ‘Titlyng’ was;
but probably he meant the Tree-Pipit, which he confounded with the
Titlark.
