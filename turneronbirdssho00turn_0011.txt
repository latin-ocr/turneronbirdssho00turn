INTRODUCTION.

WILLIAM TURNER, author of the rare treatise here re-

soon after suffered imprisonment for preaching without a

friendship with the great naturalist Conrad Gesner of Zurich,

city, who held him in high esteem, and with whom he after-

where he published not only the present work—dedicated
