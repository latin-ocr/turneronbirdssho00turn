A qm'la—Halz'ceetus 35

OF THE THIRD 1<1Nn FROM ARISTOTLE.

The third kind in colour is blackish, whence it
has received its name, so that the bird is called Pulla
and Fulvia, in size the least of all and yet chiefest
in strength. It haunts mountains and woods, and is
called also Leporaria.

P111Nv.

The bird called Melaenaetos among the Greeks,
which is the same as the Valeria, is very small in size,
but chief in strength, in colour blackish: of the Aquilae
this kind alone fosters its young, the others drive them
off: it is the only one without a scream, without a softer
note.

OF THE FOURTH KIND FROM ARISTOTLE.

The fourth kind, called Percnopterus, from having
spots upon the wings, is whitish on the head; it has
a smaller body than the other sorts spoken of hitherto.
But with its shorter wings and longer tail it has the
aspect of a Vulture. It is called besides Subaquila
and Mountain Aquila. lt dwells in woodlands, an
ignoble bird, not lacking the bad qualities of others,
but void of the good that they possess. For it is
beaten, put to ssight, and caught by the Raven and
by other birds like that. Further it is unwieldy,
sluggish to get food, and carries off dead bodies; it
is always ravenous and querulous; it cries continually
and screarns.

OF THE HALIAEETUS.

Haliaeetus in Greek and Latin, in English an Osprey,
in German eyn vish‘arn.
