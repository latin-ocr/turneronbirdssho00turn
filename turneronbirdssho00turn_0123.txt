Cras—Hirundo 9 7

have seen clouds or a storm‚ betake themselves to
earth. and take rest on the ground. They have a
leader also and those who, disposed at each end of
the band, may call out, that their voice may be per-
ceived. The others sleep when they alight, with the
head hidden underneath the wing, standing alter-
nately on either foot. The leader gazes round him
with uncovered head, and by his cry gives notice os
whatever he perceives.

Thc smallcr‚ that is younger, Cranes are called by Pliny
Vipiones‚ as young Dovcs arc known as Pipiones. Cranes,
morcover, brccd in England in marshy places, I myself have

very often scen their pipers¹, though some people born away
from England urge that this is false.

OF THE H1RUNno.

Χελιδὼν, hirundo, in English a swallowe‚ in German eyn
schwalb. Among the Saxons it is eyn swale.

A RISTOTLE.

The Hirundo feeds on flesh, and lays eggs twice
a year, for the whole winter also it lies hid. The
way of brutes upon the whole bears a marked like-
ness to the life of man, and more so in the smaller
than the larger kinds. One may observe the under-
standing way which the Hirundo foremost in the
ranks of birds shews in the constitution and con-
struction of its nest. It builds it by applying mud
to straWS‚ after the rule of daub and wattle work,
and if there ever be a scarcity of mud, it wets itself
and rolls itself in dust with all its feathers. It
moreover makes a bedding after the manner of men,
first laying a foundation of the harder stuff below,
and moderately covering the whole in proportior]
to 1ts Slze.

¹ Young pigeons are still called Pipers in England.
