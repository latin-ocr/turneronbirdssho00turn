‘DE RARIORUM ANIMALIUM ATQUE STIRPIUM
HISTORIA’ (1570).

OF THE SEA EAGLE.

HE Haliaetos is that kind of Eagle, which seeks its prey

from the sea and lakes, whence it takes its name. It is
of the size of a Kite, having the head marked with white and
dusky lines, as in a badger; an Eagle's beak3 eyes black in
the middle, golden in the outer circle; a tongue almost like
that of man, except that at the root it has an appendage on
either side; the colour above that of a Goshawk, white below;
the throat marked with rufous spots, as is the belly; the
middle of the breast pure white; the legs thick and scaly3
the foot with curved claws and blue; four toes scaly above
for quite half of their length, fissured sor the rest, rough on
the lower part and sharp sor a firm hold; and these so strong
that you can scarcely straighten them by any force when
bent. This bird is a preyer upon fishes, the water being cleft
by the shock of its body as it plunges, and on them it lives.
And though it lives on fishes‚ yet it is cloven on each foot,
not webbed on one as the vulgar think. Giraldus Cambrensis
in his book on the Topography of Ireland, when he treats of
unequally formed birds, calls this the Aurifrisius¹; and writes
in common with the vulgar that it has one soot free-toed and
armed with claws, the other closed (with webs). The length
of the wing surpasses that of the body, for it extends to two
Roman feet and eleven incheS. In this affair an opinion has
grown up among our common people in Britain, that such a
natural power exists in this bird that any fish which it sees turns
upwards on its back as soon as possible and rises to the surface

1 Aurifrisius must be the Latinized form of the old French name
‘Orfraie'—which, like Osprey, is a corruption of Osszjsrrqgra.
