or spreads again according as it is disposed, as a horse pricks
or droops its ears. It has very short legs and rounded wings,
while it flies somewhat slowly.

OF THE URINATRIX.

A RISTOTLE.

But other animals in truth live in the water and
thence seek their food, yet they breathe air and not
moisture‚ and they are wont to breed out of the water.
Now there are many of this sort, in part going afoot,
35 are the Lutra, Latax‚ and Crocodilus; and in part
winged, as the Mergi and the Urinatrices.

Aristotle makes mention only of one kind of Urinatrix‚
but I have observed three kinds of Urinatrices. Of these the
first is wholly black, and, except for the tuft it bears upon its
head, is not unlike the Mergus otherwise, so far as the
outline of its body goeS, though it is one-third less in size.
This is the sort our sailors 6311 the Loun, but others the Douker.
The second kind, no bigger than a Thrush, is like a Duck in
colour and in form of body; this the English 6311 the middle
Urinatrix. The third kind, when it is but newly hatched,
recalls 3 Gosling‚ so that if its beak were not 3 little more
slender you could scarce discern the one bird from the other.
For it has no quills‚ but in place of these 3 sort of down.
These three kinds for the most part live on stagnant waters
or not very rapid rivers, on the banks of which grow reeds
and sedges.

OF THE VULTUR.

Γύψ, vultur, in English 3 geir, in German eyn geyr.

ARISTOTLE.

The Vulture nests in very lofty rockS, and thus it
chances that the nest and young are rarely to be seen.
