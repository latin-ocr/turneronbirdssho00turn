PLINY.

The Haliaeetus remains, with eyesight of the keen-
est, poising itself alost when it spies fishes in the sea
below, then dashing heacllong on them and securing
them, the waters being parted by its breast.

Anls‘roTLE.

The Haliaeetos, that is to say Sea Eagle, has
the neck both big and thick, bowed wings, and
a broad tail. It bides upon the sea-coast and the
shores. It often happens, when it cannot list what
it has taken, that it is submerged beneath the tide.

The Osprey is a bird much better known ‘to-day to
Englishrnen than many who keep fish in stews would
wish; for within a short time it bears off every fish.
Our anglers srnear or mix their bait with Osprey's fat,
arguing that thus the bait will prove more efficacious from
the fact that, when the Osprey hovers in the air, whatever
fishes be below turn up and shew their whitish bellies (as it
is believed, the nature of the Aquila compelling them to
this), that it may choose that one which it prefers..

OF THE TRUE AQUILA FROM ARISTo'rLE.

The sixth kind rnen call Genuine, or true and
thoroughbred. Of all the various kinds of Aquilae
this is the only one that is believed to be of true
and unstained origin. This is the largest of all
Aquilae and bigger even than the Ossifrage‚ for it
surpasses by one half as much the other Aquilae;
in colour it is reddish brown, but it is rarely seen.

OF THE ARDEA.

ἐρωδιός, ardea, in English a heron, in German eyn
reyger.
