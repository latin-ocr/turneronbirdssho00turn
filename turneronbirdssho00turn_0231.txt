very great luxury with υς, and of great price. It is a mimic.
And so, as the Scops and Otus are taken by an imitation of
dancing‚ this bird is caught at night by the light of a candle
according to the motion of the captor. For if he stretches
out an arm, the bird lifts a wing3 if he stretches out a leg, it
does likewise. In short, whatever part the fowler plays, the
bird does the same. So being intent on the man's actions, it
is fooled by the bird-catcher and caught in his net. It is a
little bird, of the size of a Starling, with only three fore-toes

Α and no hind-toe, a black crown, white cheeks, and colour almost

that of a Quail, if you were to mix with it a little ash-colour,
especially round the neck. Ι call it Morinellus for a double
reason, both because it is a bird most abundant among the
Morini, and because it is a foolish bird, foolishness being by
the Greeks called μωρότης. On this account our people also
call it Doterell‚ as if they were to say doating with folly.

OF THE PUPHIN OR PUPIN.

There is a certain sea-bird of our country, in size and
form of body like a little Duck (which the Greeks call βόακας),
with webbed and reddish feet, placed nearer to the hinder
parts than in other web—footed kinds except the Pygosceles:
with a somewhat thin beak, rather more extended in breadth
vertically than stretching laterally to a very great length,
furrowed by four red grooves above, and two below, pale
ochre in colour. The part lying between these and the head
is bluish, and of such a shape as is the moon, when ten days
have elapsed from conj unction. The bird is black on the upper
surface of the whole body, save where the eyes are set, which
are enclosed in white: but it is wholly white below, save on
the upper breast, where it is black. It gets its living from the
sea. This bird our people call the Puphin, we say Pupin
from its ordinary cry of “pupin.” It hides in holes‚ as the
Charadrius does. And so it is driven out from a rabbit's
burrow by a ferret turned in by any hunter in a place situated
not far from the sea. It is used as fish among us during
the solemn fast of Lent: being in substance and taste
not unlike a Seal. It is a gregarious animal, and has its
proper time for lying hidden, as the Cuckoo and Swallow.
