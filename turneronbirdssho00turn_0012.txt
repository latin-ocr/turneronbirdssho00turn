viii Introduction

to Edward Prince of Wales (afterwards King Edward the
Sixth)—but also edited the Dialogus de Avibus of his friend
Gybertus Longolius of Utrecht‚ who died the preceding year.
He pursued his botanical studies in several parts of Germany‚
as well as in the Netherlands‚ including East Friesland, for
he became physician to the Count of Emden, and visited the
islands of Juist and Norderney lying off the coast of that
province.

On the death of King Henry the Eighth he returned to
England‚ becoming chaplain and physician to Lord Protector
the Duke of Somerset; but he lived at Kew, where he
established a botanic garden. He was, moreover, incor-
porated MD. of Oxford, and was appointed a prebendary
of York. In 1550 the Privy Council sent letters for his
electiori as Provost of Oriel College in Oxford, but the post
had been already filled, and a similar disappointment awaited
him in regard to the Presidency of Magdalen College in the
same University. He then applied to Sir William Cecil for
leave to return to Germany, but was soon after consoled by
being appointed Dean of wells, and, having in 1551 published
the first part of his New Herbal, was during the next year
ordained priest by his old friend Ridley, then Bishop of
London.

On the accession of Queen Mary Turner had to vacate his
deanery, and betook himself for safety once more to the
Continent, visiting Rome and several places in Germany and
Switzerland. When Queen Elizabeth ascended the throne he
returned to England, and recovered his deanery, to which
was attached the rectory of VVedmore in Somersetshire; but
in 1564 he was suspended for nonconformity and seems to
have come to live in London. In 1557 he had addressed
a letter on English Fishes to Gesner, which was included
in that naturalist's Historia Am'malinm; and in 1562 he
published the second part of his Herbal, which he dedicated
to Lord Wentworth, the son of his original benefactor. On
the 7th of July 1568 Turner died at his house in Crutched

Friars in the City of London, and was buried in the church of
St Olave‚ Hart Street.
