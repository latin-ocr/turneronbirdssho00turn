between the poll and the flesh on the right and left is white
and unfeathered, mixed with light blue. The colour of the
poll and peak of the head is exactly the same as that of the
toes. The legs are black, marked in front with a double scaly
fissure, on the back with none, but smooth, and sprinkled
as it were with some spots, of a peculiar colour. The colour
below the jaws is exquisite purple; on the neck dark purple3
on the rest of the body, if you look from above, it stands out
as if you sprinkled black and white fiour, ground very fine with
dusky colour at intervals, and yet did not mix thern up. On
such a ground oval or round white spots seem to be imposed
throughout the whole body, smaller above and larger below,
arranged in lines at intervals (as appears in the natural
structure of feathers) which cut one another here and there in
reciprocal oblique arrangement, only on the top of the body,
however, and not below. This you will observe not only
from the body as a whole, but from individual feathers if
plucked out. For the upper feathers, with their oblique lines
cutting one another reciprocally, or, if you will it, with certain
rounds composed of black and white flour (as I have said),
and meeting towards the tipS, as in honey-combs or nets,
enclose oval or round white spots within dusky spaces: but
the lower do not. Both, however, are arranged by a similar
law, for on some feathers they are so joined in rows as to
almost make acute triangles; in others so as to present an
oval form. Of this kind there are three or four rows on each
feather, so that the smaller are contained in the compass of
the larger. At the tips of the wings and on the tail, spots
lie along the length in equidistant straight lines. You can
hardly distinguish between the cock and the hen, so great
is the likeness, save that the head of the hen is wholly black.
The voice is a shrill double cry, not more sonorous or louder
than that of the Quail,but like that ofthe Partridge,except that
the latter is lower, and not so clear. In running it is swift.
