L ntea—L uleola ——L uscire ia 1 09

The little bird, which I believe to be the Latous. is some-
what bigger than a Sparrow. It is yelloxv on the breast and
belly in the cock3 but in the hen the breast is yellow and
the belly pale. Yellow are mixed with dark feathers upon
the head, back, and wings. In each of them the beak is
short ancl stout, and on it one may find a sort of knob
that simulates a tooth. Apart from worms it eats barley
and oats freely. The tail of this small bird is rather long
and is in constant motion.

OF THE LUTEOLA.

Χλωρίς, luteola, in English a siskin, in German eyn zey-
sich, or of some eyn engelchen.

The Luteola is much smaller than the Lutea above de-
scribed, and with a colour tending more to green. It has
a yellow breast, a longish, slender, pointed bill, like that
in Aurivittis‚ and two spots of black, one on the forehead,
one beneath the chin; it warbles with some sweetness. In
England it is rare, and scarcely to be seen elsewhere than
in cageS. Yet Ι remember having seen it once among the

fields of Cambridgeshire. Of thisv kind are those which
England calls Canary birds¹.

OF THE LUSCINIA.

Ἀηδών, luscinia, philomela, in English a nyghtyngall‚ in
German eyn nachtgall.

AR1sToTLE.

In summer the Luscinia lays five or six eggs,
but from autumn it lies hid continually until the days
of spring. Now the Luscinia is wont to sing in-
cessantly for fifteen days and nights, When woods
begin to become dark with foliage. Later it sings
indeed, but not incessantly, then in the height of
summer it gives forth a different note, not varied
over and above, or quick and modulated‚ but a simple

¹ Gesner, the first to describe the (janam-bird, states that Turner
informed him of it.
