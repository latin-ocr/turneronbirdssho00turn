OF THE CORer.

Κορώνη, cornix, in English a crow, in German eyn krae
and eyn kraeg.

The Crowl is an omnivorous bird, for it eats flesh and
fish and sometimes grain; it much frequents sea-coasts and
river-banks, that it may there obtain those animals which
the tide has thrown up. The Crow is wholly black and is
midway in size between a Daw and a Raven.

There also 15 3 certain Sea Crow, which some call the
Winter Crow'²‚ with black head, tail, and wings and the
remainder grey: but whether Aristotle or Pliny ever saw this
bird Ι am uncertain, for they have not mentioned it in any
place. There still remains another Crow³‚ a grain-eater‚ with
white beak, but black otherwise. Longolius conjectured this
to be Aristotle‘s σπερμολόγος, that is frugilega.

OF THE CORVUS.

Κόραξ, corvus, in English a raven, in German eyn rabe.

The Raven, inasmnch as it is bigger than the Crow‚ quite
black, and a flesh-eater, is sufficiently well known to all.
In places with less space, and where there is not room for
many, Ravens dwell only in pairs, and, when their young
have just gained power of ssight, the parents first banish
thern from the nest, and later drive them out of the whole
neighbourhood. The Raven has a brood of four or five.

OF THE CULICILEGA.

Kvmroxdeyoet Culicilega, in English a wagtale, in German
eyn wasser steltz, eyn quikstertz.

AmsTOTLE.

The Culicilega is a bird of the same size as the
Spinus, ash—coloured‚ and marked with spots: its voice
is poor; moreover it pecks wood.

The Culicilega Ι judge to be that little bird, which some
name Motacilla‚ inasmuch as it is variously marked with

¹ The Carrion Crow (Corvus corone).

2 The Hooded or Grey Crow (Corvus cornix).

³ The Rook (Corvus frugilegas).

⁴ Sundevall thinks that this bird is Certlzia familiaris.
