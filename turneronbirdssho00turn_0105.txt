Fulz'ca— Gavz'a 79

this bird in mind, from the time that I read Aristotle's
History of Animals, and then especially when through the
wind failing or blowing contrary, the anchor being dropped,
we have been calmly awaiting a more favourable wind. The
anchor being weighed this bird immediately flies to us in
the company of Gulls, promising something to itself by way
of food out of the refuse cast forth from the ship; at last
exhausted by its constant cries it merely utters “keph‚'’ as
Gulls cry “cob.'' And hence they are called Sea-Cobs by
our countrymen. It may be that some of the race of Fulicae
are grey, though Pliny, when on the authority of Juba
he relates that the birds known as Diomede's are white
like Fulicae, seems to put down all Fulicae as white3 for
classical authorities speak not in any class of what more
rarely, but of what more frequently occurs, Gulls nest in

the same places as do Fulicae, forsooth on lofty crags and
rocks about the sea.

OF THE GAVIA.

Λάρος, gavia, a se cob or a see-gell.

Aristotle makes two kinds of Gaviae, one white, which
seeks its food about the sea, the other grey, which seeks it
round the lakes and rivers. Now I think that the white
Gavia differs but little from the Fulica, only indeed as to
the hood and beak. The grey Gavia, which comes up to our
rivers and lakes, is always querulous and full of noise. It
catches little fishes and eats worms upon the banks of lakes.
There is another small bird of this kind, called Stern¹ in local
dialect, which is so like the sea Lari that it seems to differ
from them only in its size and colour; for it is a Larus,
though smaller than the sea Lari and blacker. Throughout
the whole of summer, at which time it breeds, it makes such
an unconscionable noise that by its unrestrained clamour it
almost deafens those who live near lakes and marshes. This
Ι certainly believe to be the bird whose vile garrulity gave
rise to the old Proverb “ Larus parturit.'' It is almost always
flying over lakes and swamps‚ never at rest, but always open-
mouthed for prey. This bird nests in thick reed-beds. The
sea Gaviae breed on crags and rocks about the sea.
