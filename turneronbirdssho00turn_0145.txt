and gristly head, and is a little smaller than a Thrush
in size; the bill is strong but small, and curved; in
colour it is wholly grey, while it is weak-footed and
feeble on the wing, it is caught chiefly by the Noctua.

The Molliccps Ι think to be that little bird which Germans
call nuinmurder, not without a cause. Further that it may
be quite clear to all which and what sort of bird it really is,
I will touch on its form and habits as compendiously as
may be. In size it equals the least 01 1116 Thrushes, and
to one observing from afar seems wholly grey. And yet,
to one inspecting it more nearly, the chin, 1116 1316351 31161
belly appear white, and from each eye there reaches to the
neck, although somcwhat oblique, a long black patch. It
has so big a head that (were the bill longer 31161 lai-ger) it
assuredly would answer in proportion for a bird of thrice its
size. The bill is black and moderately short, and hooked
at the tip, but is the stoutest and strongest of all, so much
so that the bird once wounded my hand, although protected
by 3 double glove‚ and very speedily it crushes and breaks up
the bones and skulls of birds. Each wing is wholly black,
except that 3 11111116 11116 01 501116 size marks transversely the
middle 01 1116 wing on either side. The tail 15 like that of
3 Pie, that is to say, longish 31161 particoloured. Of 311 11
1135 1116 511011651 legs and 1661 proportionately to its body,
and these parts are black. It has short wings, and fiies as
if by 1301111615 upwards and dowmvards. It lives on beetles,
butterflics, and biggish insects, and not only these, but also
birds 31161 1116 manner 01 3 Hawk. For it kills Reguli and
Finches and (35 01166 Ι saw) Thrushes; and bird-catchers
even report that it from time to time slays certain woodland
Pies, and can put Crows to flight. It does not seize the birds
it kills with 115 6131115, after a swist ssight, 35 Hawks do, but
attacks them stealthily and soon (35 Ι have often had ex-
pericnce) aims at the throat and with its beak squeezes and
breaks the skull. Then it devours the crushed and bruised
bones, and when anhungered crams into its gullet lumps of
flesh as big as the gape’s nai-rowness can take. Again,
beyond the habit of the rest 01 birds, when prey happens
to be more plentiful, it lays by some 101 future scarcity.
