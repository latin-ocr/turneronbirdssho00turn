Galle· and Gallz'nae— Gallz'nago 87

colouring. Of certain kinds os birds the eggs are
white, as those of Columbae and Perdices, others are
pale, as those os marsh-birds; others marked with
spots, as those of Meleagrides and Phasiani.

In those few authors, whose works I have scanned, not
a few of the things which they have treated are disputable.
First Varro tells us that the wild-bred Gallinae are not like
those os country—houseS, but the African3 while Columella
states that the wild sort is not unlike that of the country-
house. Varro makes the Africanae to be the MeleagrideS,
which Pliny also seems to do. Yet Columella separates the
Africanae from the Meleagrides by various characters. And
Aristotle makes his Hadrianic fowls of various colours‚ as
does Pliny also, and of little size. But Varro makes the
Africanae big and of varied colours, though it is quite clear
that they are nothing but the Hadrianic birds. But after
all it is not in my power to adjust the mutual differences
of authors, when so great; and yet in a few words I will
disclose what Ι think of these kinds. The wild Gallina is
not found with us in any part, if it be not that which they
name Morhen, and this I formerly conjectured to be the
Attagen sor several reasons. The Meleagrides of Columella
seem to be those birds which some call Indian peacocks¹‚
for they are admitted to have wattles and blue crests.

OF THE GALLINAGO.

Ἀσκαλώπαξ2, gallinago‚ in English a wod cok, in German
eyn holtz snepff.

ARIsToTLE.

The Gallinago is taken among the hedges of our
gardens; it is of the size of a Gallina, but has a long
bill, and the eolour of the Attagena: it runs with
speed, while it is wonderfully fond of man. This bird
never sits on a tree and it nests on the ground.

¹ Turner was, of course, wrong in his conjecture.
2 Turner makes σκολόπαξ the same as ιὶσκαλώπαξ.
