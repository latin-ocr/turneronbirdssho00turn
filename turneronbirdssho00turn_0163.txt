Regulus) and certainly towards the upper border of the
wing the colour is more nearly grey. And though it
takes short flights‚ its natural energy is worthy of all
admiration.

In this description there is nothing that does not agree
exactly with the little bird, which Englishmen name Passer
sepiarius‚ the bird—catchers of Cullen the koelmusch. But
inasmuch 35 both in Germany and England it 15 called by
various names, and all men do not recognise it by the same,
l will subjoin those of its appellations which Ι know, that 5ο
it may be known to all.

By the English it is called a Hedge-Sparrow‚ which
15 the same 35 Passer sepiarius, and also a Dike Smouler,
one, that 15, hiding itself in hedges. The common people
of Cullen call it eyn grassmusch, but those who know
better and fowlers name it eyn koelmusch, that is, a Sparrow
dwelling within holes and cavernS. Now here I wish the
Germans to bc ivai-ned, that since there are two birds called
grasmusch in their tongue, the Troglodytes is that kind alone
which throughout the year 15 noticed to be like the Regulus
and not that which is feathered round the jaws, and goes
away so soon 35 winter comes. Of this Passer 1 once met
with a nest built on the ground among nettles and Ι have
often seen young having left the nest before that they
could fly, creeping among the grass and shrubs. It feeds
on worms, and it 15 wont a little before evening to cry out

with not a little vehemence; it goes to roost almost the last
of all the birds.
