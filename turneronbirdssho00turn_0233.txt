Α ppendix 20 7

It lays for the most part two eggs in rabbit burrows in the
earth. It does not trust to its wings save in sight of the sea.
It seems a lazy animal, but patient of injury. It eats flesh
more readily than fish, and that of a rabbit in preference to
that of any other animal, but in either case raw: it throws up
what is boiled or roasted. Other human victuals it does not
touch. In summer it washes itself but never drinkS, so sar as
can be ascertained by observation ; whether this was because
salt water was wanting, Ι know not. The droppings are like
those of an Accipiter. When there was nothing to eat it
begged for food with its ordinary cry repeated and lowered‚ by
calling out “pupin‚ pupin.’' I kept one at my house for eight
months It bit with right good will those who supplied it with
food or touched it, but in a mild and harmless way. It was
satisfied with little food. For it is not a voracious bird, as our
Corvorant is, which you (dearest Gesner) rightly name Corvus
aquaticus and Magrus, while our 960916 corruptly say Cormo-
rant, not knowing from the derivation of the word that it
ought to be called the Crow that devours. And this it does
naturally, since it is endowed by nature with only one in-
testine straight and without a coil (as they say), on account
of the vehemence of the natural heat, which very quickly
consumes all that it swallows.

OF THE SPERMOLOGUS OR FRUGILEGA.

Our Spermologus differs in nothing from a black Crow,
save in the harmlessness of its habits, in the προλόβος or crop,
which holds the grain as it is picked up, that it may bear it to
its young (for it is pouched): in the white callus, which
extends from the base of the beak to the head; and in its
voice, which is guttura] and harsh. Whence possibly by our
people, among whom there exist many Latin and Greek
names for things (as we have said in our book on the
Harmony of British words) it is called Rouke, as if it should
be called Rauce by the English and Raucus by the Latins:
also in food it differs from the Crow in that it eats wheat,
barley, and other seeds (whence it got the name of σπερμο-
λόνγος among the Greeks. It also eats wormS, when there is
not plenty of corn or grain. Hence our country 960916 doubt
