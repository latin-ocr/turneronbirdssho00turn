is known, at least in the land of Italy, by another
name; it is not seen for long, since it conceals itself,

Aristotle provides no special mark, save one, by which
the Luscinia differs from the rest of birds, and that is that
it lacks the point at the tip of the tongue. Though even this

and the Mergi when the spring arrives after the
solstice. They incubate like other birds. but neither

trees, but Aristotle says on sea-rocks. What each man saw
or learnt from the reports of bird-catchers he has set down
in writing. And I have observed both birds myself, sor
I have seen Mergi nesting on sea-cliffs about the mouth
of the Tyne river, and on lofty trees in Norfolk with the
