Germany‚ who will have it that the Fulica is their Kywit,
possibly resting their opinion on what they have read in
Pliny of a tuft being attributed to the bird Fulica. The
Kywit of the Germans is, however, smaller than a Cornix,
with the plumage almost green and black on the whole back
and head and neck, the belly white, a long and always
upright feathery crest upon the head, and somewhat rounded
wings, which during flight make a great hurtling‚ whence it
is even named by foreigners Vannellus. It approaches waters
for the sake of worms² on which alone it seeds, but does not
enter them. It mostly lives in open country, and in places
overgrown with heather. Our people often keep this bird in
gaudens to destroy the worms.

And yet what Vergil in this manner writes in the first
book of his Georgics of the Fulica will not permit this bird
to be his Fulica:-

“And now the waters scarce restrain themselves from the ships'
curving keels, while the swift Mergi wing their way once more out of the
Ocean’s midst, bringing their noisy voices to the shore, and while the
Fulicae‚ frequenters of the sea, disport themselves on land.’'

Hence it is clear enough that the Kywit is not the Fulica,
since it is not a sea-bird nor a water-bird. There are not
wanting those who would have that black W'ater Hen‚ with
a white frontal patch, to be the Fulica1. But on the strength
of Vergil and Aristotle such are easily convicted of mistake,
for one of these makes it a sea-bird, and the other, namely
Aristotle in the eighth book of his History of Animals, bears
witness that it lives about the sea. Wherefore‚ since that
Marsh Hen is neither a sea-bird nor seeks its food about
the sea, but constantly haunts pools‚ and marshes, and fresh
waterS, it can neither be the Fulica of Vergil nor the κέπφος
of Aristotle. But it still remains that Ι should shew what bird
I judge the Fulica to be.

There is a sea-bird ², like a Daw in size, but with the wings
sharper and longer, wholly white in colour, save for a black
patch which it bears on the head, and with the beak and feet
of purplish red. I often, journeying upon the sea, have had
