red on the top near the head, pale on the remainder, nor is it
sharp at the end, but blunt. It is an acceptable bird for the
table.

OF THE DOMESTIC GETULIAN HEN.

The domestic Getulian Hen‚ is a little smaller than our
own, in colour dull rufous above, pale below, with an erect
erest of disintegrated feathers on the head, a serrated comb‚
low, simple and fleshy: more continuously noisy than ours
are, when they cluck: with the legs and feet feathered, for
the most part outwardly and behind as in Doves, that the
progress should not be hindered by feathers on the inside,
otherwise it is like the common kind.

OF THE MELEAGRIS.

The Meleagris is a very beautiful bird, like to a Pheasant
in bigness of body, form, beak and foot: provided with a
horny poll rising to an abrupt horny peak at the back, which
slopes down gently in front. Nature seems to have designed
to join and bind this to the lower part of the head by three
hanging lappets as it were; one on each side between the eye
and the ear, and also one on the middle of the forehead, all of
the same colour as the poll, so that it sits on the head in the
same way that the ducal cap does on that of the most noble
Duke of Venice, if that part which is usually in front be
turned behind. It is wrinkled round about belOW, but verti-
cally where it rises above. From the top of the neck to the
occiput spring certain erect black bristles (not feathers),
turned backwards. The eyes are wholly black, and equally
so are the eyelids and eyelashes around them, if you except
a mark on the top and back of each eyebrow. A kind of
callous flesh of a blood-red colour covers the lower part of the
head along its length; nature has designed that it should be
folded, and should not hang forward like the wattle of the
Fowl, and being led backward end in two acute processes
free from the head. From this fiesh rise on either side
caruncles, by which the nostrils are clothed round about, and
by which the head is divided in front from the rest of the
pale-coloured beak. The lower edges of these by the beak
are also folded slightly under each nostril. What intervenes
