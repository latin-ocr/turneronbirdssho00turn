Regtclus—Rubecnla—Rulicilla 1 5 5

The Trochilus is smallest of all birds, with a long tail¹
always cocked up, and a bill somewhat long but very slender,
it is nearly reddish-brown in colour. The nest it makes is
outwardly of moss and inwardly of feathers‚ wool, or down,
but mainly of feathers. The nest has the form of an upright
egg standing on one of its ends, while in the middle of one
side there is a little postcrn as it were, by which the bird
goes in and out. It sometimes builds its nest at the back
of a house or in sheds thatched with straw, but usually in
woods It also is a bird that roves alone, and never flies
in flocks; nay more, so often as it meets another of its
kind it forthwith declares war, and fights. Wherefore the
birds with plumes of gold-colour that they wear on their
heads like golden crowns‚ which pass the summer in
Bavaria in woods, and in the winter flock to towns, are
not the Reguli of Aristotle, as 1 presently shall prove, but
the Tyranni.

OF TIIE RUBECULA AND THE RUTICILLA.

Ἐρίθακος, ἦ ἐριθέα, rubecula, in English a robin redbreste,
in German eyn rotbrust or eyn rotkelchen.

Φοινίκουρος, and, as another text has it, φοινικούρνγος, in
Pliny phoenicurus, the ruticilla of Gaza, in English a redestale‚
in German eyn rotstertz.

ARIsTo'rLE.

The Rubecula and the Ruticilla seed on worms.
Rubeculae and Ruticillae, as the birds are called, change
into one another, and what in winter is the Rubecula
in summer is the Ruticilla²‚ while they hardly differ
from each other save in colour of the breast and tail.

¹ Turner evidently means the VVren (Trcggtlodylcs parvulus), but with
this the ‘long tail' does not agree; perhaps there is a misprint.

² As Sundevall remarks, Aristotle probably only meant that the Red-
start was called φοινίκουρος in summer and ἐρίθακος in winter. Sundevall
ascribes the misinterpretation to Gaza, whose work Turner admittedly
used. This is the more likely as the section of Aristotle quoted concerns
birds which change their plumage and note at different seasons.
