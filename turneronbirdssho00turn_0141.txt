Merops—Merula 1 1 5

Now the Green Picus makes itsels a nest with its own bill
in trees: for when a Picus hammering on a tree discovers
by the sound that it is hollow at the core, the breeding
season being close at hand, it bores that with its bill in
which it afterwards intends to nest. There is not anywhere
a trec so tall which this bird cannot reach by means
of flight‚ for any weight of body that it has Its plumage
is moreover green above and, if my memory serves me,
yellow underneath, or pale at least. Since then the Merops,
hindered by its weight of body is incapable of rising to
a height, and thus of making nests in trees, and has blue
upper parts, the grunspecht of the Germans, which the
Britons from the holes it makes call huhol [that is, Hew-
hole], cannot be the Merops known to Aristotle and Pliny.

Or THE MERULA.

Κόττυφος, merula, in English a blak osel, a blak byrd,
in German eyn merl or eyn amsel.

A RisTo'rLle.

Of Merulae there are two sortS. one black and
common, and the other white, of equal size indeed
and having a like voice, but which is well-known
round Cyllene in Arcadia, and not bred elsewhere.
There is of this kind another also, Which is like the
black, but dull in colour and a little less in size. It
usually haunts rocks and roofs, but has not the bill
ruddy like the Merula. The Merula in colour and
in voice moreover changes with the season‚ for it
turns from black to rufous, and utters a different cry.
For it chatters in winter, but sings lustily in summer¹.

Pan.

From black the Merula turns rufOUS‚ in summer
it sings, but in winter it babbles, and about the solstice

¹ The readings in Aristotle differ considerably. ‘Sings lustily' may
go with ‘in winter!
