E pisile Dedz'calory 5

Inasmuch therefore as so many senses are requisite
in the head, which is set over one body alone, how
many senses and what a wealth of wisdom and learn-
ing are demanded from that head, to whom more than
three hundred thousand bodies are given in charge?
But if any should chance to answer that learning and
wisdom are needed not in the Prince, but only in
those who are his councillors, I should consider it
fitting that he for such a reply should be set, accom-

of touch, and should tell us whether he preferred to
use his own senses or those of others: or whether it
would be safer for him to be led by the senses of
his doubting guides or by his own; and in what way
he, being blind and deas, and destitute of smell and

fatal advice, unless he either excels or at least equals
his councillors in learning and wisdom? Wherefore
not only in councillors but in the Prince himself are
learning and wisdom requisite. There are not want-

in which he should surpass other mortals, if he out—
shines his subjects in royal garb, in riches, in resourceS,
in cunningly striking the lyre, and in skilfully throwing
the spear; but all the bravest and wisest kings have
