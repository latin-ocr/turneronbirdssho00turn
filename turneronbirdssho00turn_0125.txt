Hirundo 99

Pva.

Hirundines build nests of mud, and strengthen
them with straw. And if there ever be a scarcity
of muel, they sprinkle a good store of water from
their feathers on the dust‚ which is thus moistened.
The nest itself they further line throughout with soft
seathers and wool, to thus keep the eggs warm, and
also that it may not be too hard for the young chicks.

There is another sort of the Hirundines of the
country ancl the fielcls, which rarely build their
nests in houses. different in shape, but of the
same material, ancl facing wholly upwarcls, having
entrances prolonged into a strait with a capacious
belly¹; it is wonderful how skilsully they are adapted
for concealing young, and soft for them to lie upon.

There is a third kind of Hirundines which bore
in banks, ancl thus breed within holes. These make
no 116515, and migrate many (lays before, if it be likely
that the stream in flood should reach them.

01³ THE Aponus, FROM ARISTOTLE.

Some birds are weak-footed, and for that reason
from the smallness of their feet are known as ApodeS.
This kind of little bird is very strong upon the
wing, just as some others that are nearly like it
seem to lose in strength of foot proportionately as
they gain in power of flight, as the Hirundo and the
Falcula, in other words Riparia. For all these in
their habits, flight‚ and look seem very near each
other. The Apes may be seen at all times of the
year, but the Riparia only in summer, when the rains
begin: for then it is both noticed and is caught. In

¹ Pliny evidently refers to Hirundo rusula, which builds a 11351(-
shapcd nest against a clisf.
