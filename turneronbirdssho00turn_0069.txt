waste open places, and especially those covered with heather.
They seed on grain and on the topmost buds of heather.
They have short wings and take short flights. This bird,
if it be not the Attagen, appears to be Varro's Gallina
rustica. Erasmus in his proverb of “the Attagena’s new-
moon²¹ makes his Attagena a marsh-bird‚ marked with
varied spots, If this approved itself sufficiently to me
Ι confidently would venture to affirm that the Attagena was
what the English call the Godwitt or Fedoa¹. Furthermore
the bird is so much like the Woodcock, that, if it were not
a little larger, and did not the breast verge upon ash-colour,
the one of them could hardly be distinguished from the
other. It is found in marshy places and on river banks.
The beak is long3 but in captivity it feeds on wheat, just as
our Pigeons do. With us it sells for thrice as much again
as any Woodcock, so much doe-s its flesh tickle the palates
of our magnates, Of these two, if neither be the Attagena,
then Ι have nowhere seen the Attagena.

OF THE ATRICAPILLA.

The Atricapilla‚ as some report‚ lays the most
eggs of all, next to the Struthio of Africa. No fewer
than seventeen eggs of the Atricapilla have been
found, but it lays even more than twenty and, as
some narrate, in number always odd. It also nests
in trees and feeds upon small worms. Ι1 is peculiar
to this and the Luscinia beyond all other birds that
they have no point to the tip of the tongue. Fice-
dulae and Atricapillae change in turn. For when
autumn sets in the bird becomes a Ficedula‚ from
autumn onwards it becomes an Atricapilla‚ nor is
