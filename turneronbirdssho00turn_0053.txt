A nser 29

marvellous to those who may have read what Aristotle
wrote about the flying creature called Ephemerus Now
Aristotle writes thus of the Ephemerus in the fifth book of
his History of Animal&—

“The river Hyppanis¹, near the Cymerian Bos-
phorus² when the solstice is nigh‚ brings down small
pouches, as it were, each larger than a grape, from
which four-footed flying creatures burst; a sort of
animal which lives and flies until the asternoon of the
same day, but presently at the sun’s going down
withers and languishes, and finally, at the sun’s setting,
dies, lasting no longer than a single day, whence it
is called Ephemerus, that is, the creature of a day.'’
Thus Aristotle writes

Now if these things are true, and worthy of the great
philosopher, they will impart no little credibility as to the
generation of the aforesaid bird.

The second Goose, of which I promised Ι would speak,
is a sea-bird, which lives by hunting fishes‚ sornewhat less
in size than the Goose given above; and yet in voice and
aspect it recalls the Goose in every way; it nests within the
Scottish sea, upon the lofty cliffs of the Bass Isle—so called,
as I opine, by an antiphrasis³-and nowhere else in all
Britain. This bird looks to its young with so much loving
care, that it will fight most gallantly with lads that are let
down in baskets by a rope to carry them away, not without
danger of its life. Nor must we fail to mention that a salve,
most valuable for many a disease, is made by Scots frorn
the fat of this Goose (for it is wonderfully full of sat) which
may deservedly rival the Commagenum vaunted much by
Pliny, in its virtue and the number of its cures.

Now since, though searching with the greatest care,
I cannot find any more kinds of Geese among Britons,
