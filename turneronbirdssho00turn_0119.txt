Graculz' 9 3

wherefore this second kind alone shall be Monedula; more-
over Ovid happily describes its thievish habits in the
following lines 2-—

XVas changed into a bird, which even now loves gold,
Monedula the black of foot, in plumage black arrayed.

The English call the Monedula a Caddo, Chogh, or Ka;
Germans eyn dol; and Saxons eyn alke. The Monedula
is much smaller than the Pyrrhocorax, and nests in woods
and hollow trees and towers of churches The third kind
is thus described by Aristotle in the eighth book of his
History of Animals 1-—

Of web-footed birds the heavier haunt lakes and
rivers, as the Anas, Phalaris, and Urinatrix. Add to
these the Bosca‚ which is like the Anas but smaller,
and that which is called Corvus, whose size is that
of a Ciconia‚ but it has shorter legs; it is web-footed
and a swimrner: black in colom, it perches on treeS,
and nests in them. So sar Aristotle.

Unless Ι err, this Corvus is the Phalacrocorax of Pliny
and the Swiss Waltrapus1, of which Pliny writes after this

fashion :—

Further, the Attagen is caught in Gaul and Spain,
and even on the Alps, where Phalacrocoraces also are,
proper to the Balearic isles, as the Pyrrhocorax is
to the Alps.

And in another place of the same bird :—

Some animals are naturally bald, as Struthiocameli
and Corvi Aquatici‚ whence is their name among the

Greeks.

¹ ΜΓ Rothschild identifies this bird with Comatz'bz’s comata=ct
eremita (L), no doubt rightly. See Ball. Brit. Orn. Clzcb, XII. p. 56.
Novitates Zoologicce, 1897, p. 371, and Pliny, Lib; X. cap. xlviii.
