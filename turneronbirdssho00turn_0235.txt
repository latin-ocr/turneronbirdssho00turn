fulness to men, when they devour grain, the food of man.
However the number of them is so great, that they are
condemned by the laws; harmless and uscful birds in other
respects. For, when still tender from the nest, they are
used as food by country men. Only in lofty treeS, and that

OF THE SACROPSITTACUS.

I have observed that there are many kinds of ParrotS. For
some that are small, namely of the size of a Thrush, have the
whole body quite green, but the tail‚ which is long and slender‚
either yellow, green, or crimson. Again some are very
large, 01 1116 size of a Crow, altogether crimson or red, except
under the lower belly, on the ends of the wingS, and on the
tip of the tail‚ on which parts they shew greenish blue. These
have a large beak, hollow, shining and hooked, pale only in
its middle, partly black at each end, while the lower jaw
is entirely black, the cavity being filled by the tongue, which

Parrots. The cheeks on both sides are whitish on the
wrinkled skin, in shape almost obtusely triangular, the 101115 01

in such 3 way that nature seems to have intended to place

the sake of supporting the body. Brasil sends us these birds,
which we call Sacropsittaci on account of their remarkable
size. For the ancients used to call that Sacrum, which was
notable and large. As the os sacrmn, anchora sacra, falco
sacer—which they 6311 Hierqfalco, piscis sacer, ἱερὸν μένος,
fames sacra, and morbus sacer. Compare with these the
picture of this kind, which you have received from us. Other
regionS, 35 1116 Spanish Isle, Egypt and India, produce other
kinds which are midway in size, but with various colouring.
For some with the whole body grey have strong tails, some-
