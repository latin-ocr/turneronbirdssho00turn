Rubecula—Ruticr'lla—Rubetra 1 5 9

just as young small birds flutter their wings soliciting meat
from their mothers. In summer, when there is enough and
more of food found in the woods, and they are not troubled
by any cold (a thing which forces them in winter to resort to
cities, towns, and villages), Rubeculae retire to the most
solitary places with their young. And so it is no marvel
that Rubeculae do not occur in summer everywhere. And
what wonder is it that Ruticillae are not met with in winter,
since throughout the whole of winter they are hidden ? And
further, when the young Rubeculae, having almost assumed
the full red on their brcasts at the end of autumn, come
nearer to towns and villages, the Ruticillae, which were
hitherto seen during the whole summer, disappear and then
arc no more noticed till the following spring. Wherefore,
things being thus, anyone may easily perceive what gave a
handle to Aristotle or to those who reported this error to him.

OF THE RUBETRA.

Βατίς, in Latin called Rubetra, is by Aristotle classed
among the little birds that seed on worms. Beyond this Ι
cannot gucss at all what sort the bird may be. Yet Gybertus
Longolius¹ believed that the Rubetra was the Linaria or the
Miliaria, because it often perched on brambles. But since
the Bunting of the English sits so commonly on brambles,
what forbids that bird from also being called the Batis? On
this account we have no certainty as to what name, British or
German, should be given to this bird.

But inasmuch as of the birds mentioned above the one
eats seeds of grasseS‚ and the other wheat and barley, and as
Aristotle’s Batis lives on wormS, some small bird must be
chosen which eats worms and nothing else. Now such a little
bird is that called by the English Stonchatter or Mortetter
and the klein brachvogelchen of the Germans. If this be
not the Batis, it is quite unknown to me. Besides that which
the English call the Linot and the Germans the flasfinc must
be the Miliaria of older works, if we believe Ruellius-2
