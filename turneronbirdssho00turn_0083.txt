C iuclus— C lcalcis 5 7

AiusTOTLE.

The ‘Cinclus seeks its food from the 503 and from
rivers. It is cunning and is hard to catch, but grows
the gentlest of all birds when caught. It is more-
over maimed, being without control over its hinder
parts.

The little bird which Ι believe to be the Cinclus¹ is
a little bigger than the Galerita‚ with black colour on the
back, and a white belly3 while it has long shanks and a bill
by no means short: in spring it is exceeding clamorous
and querulous about the banks of rivers, where it takes
short and incessant flights.

OF T11E CHALcis.
ARISTOTLE.

The Chalcis is not 011011 50011, for it haunts moun-
tains. It 15 01 3 black colour, and of the size of the
Accipiter which they name Palumbarius. Its form 15
long and slender; the Ionians call it Cymindis. Of
it furthermore Homer makes mention in the Iliad,
wherein he says :—

The Gods know it as Chalcis, men say Cymindis.

Some there are who would make this very bird
none other than the Ptynx. By day it shews itself
but little, since it does not see clearly, although it
hunts by night, after the manner 01 1110 Aquila3 yet
with the Aquila so keenly does it strive‚ that frequently
both birds fall to the ground clutching each other,

and are caught alive by shepherds. It lays two eggs,
and nests in cliffs and caves².

l 1 Turner evidently means the Common Sandpiper (Actilz's lcypo-
eucus .

² Siundevall says that Kiilb thought that this bird was the Hawk Owl,
but himself refers it doubtfully to the Clossy Ibis (Plcgadisfizlcinellus),

which however is not a night bird and does not live on hills. Belon and
Gaza thought that it was an owl of some kind.
