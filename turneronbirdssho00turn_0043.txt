The Accipiter palumbarius¹ I take to be the Sparrow—
Hawk of the English and the Sperwer of the Germans‚
since it preys on Doves, Pigeons, and Partridges and the
bigger sorts of birds.

The Fringillarius Ι guess to be the Hobby of the English.
Now the Hobby is a very little Hawk of darker colour than
the other kinds. It has upon the head two spots of deep
black on a lighter ground. It catches for the most part
Larks and Finches, nests on lofty trees, and is not seen in
winter anywhere.

The Rubetarius I think to be that Hawk which English
people name Hen-Harrier. Further it gets this name among
our countrymen from butchering their fowls. It exceeds the
Palumbarius in size, and is in colour ashcn. It suddenly
strikes birds when sitting in the fields upon the ground, as well
as fowls in towns and villages. Baulked of its prey it steals
off silently, nor does it ever make a second swoop. It flies
along the ground the most of all.

The Subbuteo I think to be that Hawk which English-
men call Ringtail from the ring of white that reaches round
the tail. In colour it is midway from fulvous to black; it
is a little smaller than the Buteo, but much more active.
It catches prey in the same manner as the bird above.

OF THE ALCEDo.

ARISTOTLE.

The Alcedo, not much larges than the Passer, is
remarkable for being in its colour green and blue‚
and even slightly purple, not, that is to say, in sepa-
rate parts, as if it had the colour perfectly distinct,
but variably shining over every part alike of the
whole body, with the wings and head. The beak
is greenish, and is long and thin. The tribe of

¹ Later authors are probably more correct in applying this name to the
Goshawk, which suits even Turner’s account better.
