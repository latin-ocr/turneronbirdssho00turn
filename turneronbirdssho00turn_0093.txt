jerking. It mostly haunts the banks of rivers, where it
catches flics and little worms; moreover it follows the
plough for the sake of the worms which are turned up and
laid bare with the clod.

OF THE CUCULUS.

German eyn kukkuck.

By some the Cuculus is thought to come by
change of form from an Accipiter¹, since, at the
season when the former appears, the Accipiter which
it resembles is not seen. But commonly it so falls out
that the other Accipitres are likewise absent when
the Cuculus utters its earliest cry, save for a very few
days Further the bird itself is only seen for a short
time in summer; it is not observed in winter. Nor
has it the claws hooked as an Accipiter, nor yet a
head like an Accipiter: but in both of these parts it
counterfeits a Columbus rather than an Accipiter. In
naught but colour does it imitate the Accipiter, except
that in its marks, it is distinguished as it were by
lines, the Cuculus by spots. The size and mode of
ssight are like those of the least of the Accipitres,
which for the most part at the time wherein the
Cuculus appears, is not to be observed. Yet on
occasion both have been seen at once. The Cuculus,
moreover, has been known to be struck down by the
Accipiter, which thing no bird is ever wont to do to
one of its own kind. Nobody says that he has seen
young of the CuculuS, and yet it breedS, although
not in a nest which it has made itself: but sometimes

on the Continent.
