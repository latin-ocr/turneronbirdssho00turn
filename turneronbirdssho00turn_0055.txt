Aquila 3 1

the Chenerotes (which seem to me to get their name from
“love''¹) are either Bernicles‚ or the Geese of the Bass, or
are decidedly unknown to me.

OF THE AQU1LA.

ἀετὸς, aquila, in English an eagle, in German ein arn, or
ein adler.

A RISTOTLE.

Of Aquilae there are several kinds. One which
is called Pygargus from its Whitish tail‚ as though
you were to name it Albicilla‚ loves plains‚ groves,
and towns. For by-name it is called by certain Hin-
nularia. It even seeks the mountains and the wood‚
relyIng on its might. The other kinds seldom ap-
proach the plains and groveS.

Now, seeing that Pygargus is the first kind of the Aquilae,
the German scribblers err disgracefully, who reckon it their
Trapp, which is the Tetrix in the works of Aristotle and
the Tetrao of Pliny, as I shall shew afterwards. Pygargus,
if I err not, in the English tongue is called an Erne.

OF THE PLANGA on CLANGA‚ FROM ARISTOTLE.

Another kind, second in size and strength, by
name Clanga or Planga‚ generally haunts glades and
valleys and lakes. It has the by-name Anataria‚ and
Morphna from the marking on the Wing‘ as though
you should say spotted. Of this Homer makes men-
tion in the scene of Priam's death.

PLINY ΟΝ THE MORPHNA OR PLANGA.

Morphnos, which Homer also calls Percnos‚ some
name Plancus and Anataria‚ second in size and

¹ A very doubtful derivation.
