Galerz'ta 8 1

OF THE GALERITA.

Κόρυδος, ἢ κορυδαλός, in English a lerk or a laverock,
in German eyn lerch.

Pliny, in the eleventh book of his Natural History, has
shown us that Galerita¹‚ taken from a Gaulish word, was
called Alauda afterwards, wherefore I think that on Pliny's
authority the name of Galerita should be used by those
who write in Latin rather than Alauda.

ARISTOTLE‚ OF THE GALERITAE.

Of Galeritae there are two kinds, one is a crested
ground-bird, but the other lives in flocks‚ not singly
as the former. Yet in colour it is similar, though of
a smaller size, and not having a crest. Moreover it
is fit for food. The Galeritae never sit upon a tree,
but always on the ground.

The first kind given by Aristotle has in different lands
a different crest, in one place always evident, elsewhere such
that the bird can raise or lower it at will, although the size
of either is one and the same. This larger Galerita English-
men call the Lerc proper, while Aristotle's second sort is
by our countrymen named a wilde Lcrc, and by the Germans
a heid lerch; this for the most part lives in open country„
and in places overgrown with heather‚ and on banks of lakes,
for the sake of the worms on which it feeds. This bird is
smaller by nearly one half than the aforesaid, with a slender
beak, and flesh by far the sweetest.

There still remains a third kind of Galerita, the Copera
of the GermanS, thus named I believe from its very long
erest, and certainly unknown to Aristode, for it cannot be
his first kind, inasmuch as it is smaller than that bird can
be3 likewise it cannot be the smaller sort, because it has
a erest, which is not present in the latter kind. &Vherefore
this Galerita was unknown to Aristotle. And since the fowlers
of Colonia [Cullen] with one accord assure us that the Copera
(which is midway in size between Aristotle’s crested Galerita

¹ Galerita is usually supposed to have some connexion with the Latin
galea--a helmet.
