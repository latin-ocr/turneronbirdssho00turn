of the water, and therein floats as if stunned, in order that it
may more readily become a prey to the winged creature.
And therefore is its fat preserved with greater keenness by
our fisherrnen because it is believed to have the same virtue.
They are abundant with us on sea-coasts and in the Isle
of Wight. Our people call it an Osprey. In its habits it is
quiet and amenable, and most patient of hunger. For it has
lived with me for seven days without food, in deep repose;
unless indeed it was not habit that caused this, but hunger,
which tames all things It refused flesh when offered to it;
I did not offer fish, because I understood that it lived on it.
Its flesh is dark.

OF THE BRENT Goosss.

The Brent Goose is a web-footed sea-bird, of the appear-
ance of a Goose, but a little less in size, with the head small
and short and white, but the beak black, from which a black
line reaches to either eye; the neck dusky, the lower half of
the body from the breast to the tail white; the flank mouse-
coloured above (like the colour of a common Pigeon or
Crane), dusky towards the neck, and also the intermediate
parts towards the tail mouse-colouredg the wings also mouse—
coloured, equal in length to the tail, but with the feathers
darkened at the tip. The tail is black from a white base, the
foot black and webbed. It is a gregarious and noisy bird.
It lives on fish, and is common with us in Britain about the
coasts. The common people of the Britons who live on the
coast, name it a Brendgose from the varied nature of its
colouring. The London bird-dealers call it Bernacle, yet I
should think that it ought to be named Berndclac or
Brendclac‚ because the Britons of old, as also the Scots,
called all the Geese whether of the sea, marshes or lakes
“Clakes‚'' though at the present day we corruptly say Fen-
lakes and Fenlagges¹‚ when we should say FenclakeS. The
same people, moreover, call anything variegated Brend or
by metathesis Bernd. Whence an animal is said to be
bernded or brended which is variegated with white upon
a mouse-coloured ground 2, like this Goose. It is not, there-

¹ According to this notion ‘Grey-Lag' would be for ‘Grey-Clak.⁷
