Ortygromelra— Osszfraga 1 2 9

perched upon long legs because their life is passed in
marshes,

Some will have Ortygornetra to be the same as Crex
and cychranms. But Aristotle has attributed a peculiar

sort of head to Crex, and in the eighth book of his History
of Animals distinguishes his Cychrarnus from Matrix, which
he calls Ortygometra, in the following words :—

Coturnices (he says) when they come to these places
travel without guides : but when they go away set out
with the Lingulaea. the Otus, and the Matrix as their
guides. and also with the Cychramus‚ by which they
are moreover summoned back at night. And when
the fowlers have heard its cry, they know the birds'
departure is at hand.

Thus he writes.

Therefore it is impossible that the Matrix and the Cy-
chratnus should be the same. Others will have the Orty-

gometra to be the Serica of the Germans and the Daker Hen
of the English, and I should accede to their opinion, if they
could but prove the Crex to be the same as this.

OF ΤΗΚ OSSIFRAGA.
A RISTOTLE

In size the Ossifrage is greater than the Aquila, its
coloni· whitish grey¹. Both in breeding it is comely
and in way of life, it brings food home and is kindly.
For it rears its own young with care, besides those of
the Aquila. For when the latter has cast its progeny
out of the nest. the former takes them to itself‚ and
brings them up.

Ptnw.

Some there are who add that kind of Aquila,

which the Tuscans eall a bearded Ossifrage².

² l‘osslibl} Pliny means the L'ammergeier (Gypai‘tus barbatus).
