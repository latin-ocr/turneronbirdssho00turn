L {garinus ον §pinus—L ulca 107

Ι think that Aristotle’s Spinus is our Grenefinc‚ for it
lives for the most part among thorns, and feeds upon the
seeds of grasses. The bird which I believe to be the
Spinus in its size equals a Sparrow, and is wholly green,
and in this kind the male especially, the female being some-
what pale. It feeds upon the 566615 01 bigger thistles and
of burdocks, as the Aurivittis does upon the smaller3 and it
nests on branches of the willow or wild plum. It 15 a pleasant
songster, and does not refuse to draw its 10061 and water up
in little buckets.

But some one may perhaps object to me that this bird
with its green and sornewhat pretty colour cannot be the
Spinus, inasmuch as Aristotle testifies that it is common-
place in colour. Ι should like the man who thus objects
to rne to know that Aristotle equally condemns green colour
even in a bird which is entirely green, and from its greenness
has received its name. These are the words of Aristotle :—

“The Vireo, which is entirely green, is singled
out as easy to be taught, and elever for the business
of life; but it flies badly and its colour is un-
pleasing.''

So far Aristotle.

OF THE LUTEA.

Χλωρεύςῐ, 11116115 or lutea, in English a yelow ham,
a yowlryng, in German eyn geelgorst.

AmsTo'rLEss
The Luteus‚ so named from the pale colour of its
lower parts, is 01 1116 size of an Alauda. And it lays

four eggs, or even five. It builds itself a nest 01

comfrey torn up by the roots, but spreads within
a covering of wool and hair.

¹ Aristotle in his Hislory of „lm'mals mentions three birds, χλωρὶς,
χλωρίων, and χλωρεύςε but Turner's quotation with regal-d to χλωρεὺς 15
found in Aristotle under χλωρὶς in a passage (Hz‘st. An. Bk lx. 83) where
there seems to be no alternative reading.
