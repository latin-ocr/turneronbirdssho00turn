OF Tui-2 STRUTmo.

Στρουθός, λιβυκὸς, struthio or struthiocamelus, in English
an oistris, in German eyn strauss.

ARISTOTLE.

The Struthio, or Libyan bird, in like manner partly
recalls a bird, partly a quadruped, seeing that it, un-
like a quadrupecl, has wings, and yet, unlike a bird,
it does not fly alost, nor has it feathers fit for ssight,
since they resemble hairs. Likewise as if it were
a quadruped‚ it has hairs on the upper eyelid, while
the head and upper portion of the neck are bare. So
also it has somewhat hairy eyelashes, yet it is covered
with feathers beneath‚ as if it were a bird. More-
over it is biped like a bird, but yet it is cloven-footed
like a quadruped. That is, it has not toes but a
divided hoof. The cause of these things is that in
its size it is not 3 bird but 3 quadruped. For I would
almost say that 3 bird's size must be extremely small,
for it is by no means easy to move alost 3 body when
the mass is vast.

OF THE STURNUS.

Ψιίρος, sturnus, in English 3 sterlyng‚ in German eyn star
or eyn stor.

ARISTOTLE.

The Sturnus is black‚ varied with white spots, and
of the bigness of a Merula.

PLINY.

It is peeuliar to StarIIngs in their kind to fly in
crowds, and wheel about as it were in a ball, all tend-
ing to the middle of the band.
