it less than a Turdus. Therefore‚ since Ι know no other little
bird which sits upon the rushes and the reeds, save the Reed
Sparrow of the English, I believe that kind to be the Junco.
Now this bird is small, a little smaller than a Sparrow, with
a longish tail, and a black head. The other parts are brown.

OF THE LINGULACA, FROM ARISTOTLE.

Lingulaca, in Greek called γλωττίς, puts forth
a long tongue‚ whence comes its name; it is one of
the leaders of Coturnices, it has the form of a lake-

haunting bird.

OF THE LAGOPUS, FROM PLINY.

The Lagopus is in flavour excellent, its feet shaggy
as in a hare have given it this name. Otherwise it
is white, in size as the Columbi; it is not eaten
except in the land of which it is a native, since it
is not tameable while living, and when killed its flesh
soon putrefies. There is another bird of the same
name, differing but in size from the Coturnices, most
excellent for food with yellow saffron sauce.

Of this Martial makes mention in the following verse :—

If my Flaccus delights in the eared lagopes.

OF THE LIGURINUS on SPINUS.

Ἀκανθὶς, spinus, or ligurinus, in English a grene finche,
as I suppose, in German eyn kirsfincke.

Alus'ro'rLE.

The Ligurini, commonplace in mode of life and
colour‚ yet excel in pleasantness of song. And they
are of the list of birds which seed on thistle-seed.
The Florus, the Spinus, and the AEgithus shew

mutual dislike. The Spinus wages war moreover
with the Ass. ’
