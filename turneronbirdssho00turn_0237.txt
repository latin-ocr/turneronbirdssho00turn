Others are entirely green. Others, though they are green
on the body, are yellowish on the long tail. All have like

OF WHITE RAVENS.

In the year 1548, in the month of August, Ι saw two
white Ravens from the same nest, and handled them at the
very place in Cumberland of our Britain, bred on the property
of 3 lord of that county‚ and trained for bird-catching just
like hawks. For they had been taught both to sit quietly on
the arm of the falcones, and when loosed to fly as quickly as
possible to his call and sign even from a distance. Nothing
unlucky followed thern, as in the case of those white Swallows,
about which Alexander Myndius wrote according to AElian.
For he who notes a white Raven notes the colour; as he does
who 'notes 3 white Bear and a black Fox; both of which Ι
have seen here in Britain from Muscovy. Yet Ι can hardly
call a Fox black‚ although the common people call it black3
but rather dusky or dull grey on the rest of the body. For it
has only the cheeks and the legS, with the rump and the tail,
dusky.

And now those things being finished which Ι 113ν6
written to you of flying creatures, my Gesner, the fishes
follow in duc· order.
