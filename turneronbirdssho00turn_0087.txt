only in summer. Yet in spring the young are better
than in autumn, they are worst of all in summer and
at every hotter season.

Os the same he writes in another book after this
manner :—

Other birds live on cropS, as the Palumbes, the
Columbus, the Vinago and the Turtur. The Columbi
and Palumbes may be always seen, the Turtur only
in the summer. In the winter it lies hid, for it con-
ceals itself at the due time. But the Vinago is both
seen and caught in autumn, of which bird the size is
greater than that of the Columbus, but less than
that of the palumbes,

Πελειάς, which in Latin is called Livia, is that dove of
the woodlands which the English name a stocdove‚ and the
Germans eyn holtztaube.

Φάττα, in Latin Palumbes or Palumbus, is called by
Englishmen a Coushot or a Ringged Dove, and by Germans
named eyn ringel taube. It nests far otherwise than does
the Livia, for that bird sometimes breeds in hollow trees
and sometimes even in the walls of churches But the
Palumbes builds a nest of the frailest of a few small twigs
laid crosswise in a mass of ivy or upon a bough. Now
in this thing if there be anyone who places little confidence
in my opinion that our collared doves are the Palumbes of
the ancients‚ let him read with greater care his Aristotle
and give ear as well to Martial the poet writing thus of
the same birds :—

Ringed doves make a man's loins slow and dull;
Who would be lusty should not eat this bird.

Politian writes of the Palumbi thus :—

While ringed doves seek again their accustomed haunts.

Turtle Doves are much more plentiful in Germany than

in England. English and Saxons in common call it turtel
duve.
