PLINV OF '1¹11ss ATTAGEN.

The Attagen is most renowned as an Ionian bird;
it usually is noisy, in captivity however it is dumb.
In former times it was considered rare, but now it
is taken in Gaul, in Spain, and on the Alps.

PETnus fo'LLlus.

The Attagen is rather larger than the Perdix, and
is marked with particoloured feathers on the back, in
colour it is reddish, and it feeds on grain. It has
short wings, and rolls itself in dust.

Accordingly our British schoolmasters are wrong who
make their Woodcock the Attagen‚ which lives only on
worms and never touches grain. Indeed Ι seriously doubt
whether Attagenes be found in England or not, for those who
give descriptions of 'the Attagen, do not distinguish the male
from the female, whence I infer that they have the same
colours and are like in form. But in the kind of bird which
with us comes the nearest to the Attagen in form, the male
differs so greatly from the female that they might appear to
be of separate kinds to the man inexperienced in things like
this. Nevertheless Ι will describe each bird.

The male¹ is somewhat less than a domestic cock and
is entirely black, save that part of the tail which overlies
the vent, for that is white. Moreover the black colour of
the bird is somewhat glossy‚ very nearly as the collar round
the neck of our black pigeons is. So it approaches very
near to green. Upon its head it has a red but fleshy sort
of comb2‚ and round its cheeks two red lobes as it were
and those fleshy. The hen is wholly marked with spots,
and, were she not a bigger bird and more rufous, could
scarcely be distinguished from a Partridge. Both frequent

¹ 'l'urner here undoubtedly refers to the Blackcock (Tem-ao letrix).

² The Blackcock has two erectile patches of red skin over the eyes,
which in the breeding season even reach above the top of the head ; and
the word ‘cirrum‘ must be taken to mean such a patch here.
