Colias ον ζῗαζξνῑιίῑις- Graculz' 91

the head was upright‚ the beak rather long. As to whether
this may have been a kind of Galgulus, Ι do not certify‚
but I suspect it to have been.

OF THE GRACULI.

Erasmus in his very learned work on ProverbS, as often
as κολοιὸς occurs (and it occurs not seldom) renders it by
Graculus, in this thing following by no means Theodorus
Gaza—though at other times he does so freely-—who in every
case renders κολοιὸς by Monedula. And in this thing Ι also
have determined for divers reasons here to imitate Erasmus
rather than Gaza.

GAZA.

Of Monedulae there are three sorts: the first,
which is called Graculus, in size as big as Cornix
with a curved red bill. The next, also named Lupus.
small, and a mimic. The third, which is well known
in Lydia and Phrygia, is web-footed.

Now the first kind of Graculi, which the Greeks call
κορακίας, is the Pyrrhocorax of Pliny and the Cornish Choghe
of Englishrnen, eyn bergdol of the Germans. It is a little
smaller than the Cornix, with a yellow bill¹‚ not large, and
somewhat hooked towards the tip, it is abundant in the Alps
and in Cornwall in England. It has a sharper and more
querulous cry than the Monedula. The second sort called
λύκος and βωμολόχος in Greek, is by the Latins strictly
named Monedula, as if it were Monetula, from the Moneta
[money] which alone of birds, as Pliny says, it steals, The
three kinds do not all steal gold—only the second does—

¹ Here there is an evident confusion between the Chough (Pyrrho-
corax graculus) with its red bill, and the yellow—billed Alpine Chough
(P. alpinus).
