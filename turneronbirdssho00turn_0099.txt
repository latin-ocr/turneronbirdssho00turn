on worms13 but is a little bird like the grasmusch of the
Germans, living upon figs and grapes, as Martia] prettily
bears witness in these lines :—

Since the fig gives me nourishment, and 1 seed on sweet grapes,
Why has the grape not rather given me a name?

OF THE FRINGILLA.

Σπίζα, fringilla‚ in English a chaffinche, a sheld-appel²‚
a spink, in German eyn bfichfink.

Fringillae—on Aristotle's authority—in summer haunt
warm places, and in winter cold; and thence 1 think that
they received their name among the Latins³‚ for when it is
cold more are seen flocking round us than in summer time.
In size the bird equals a Sparrow and is marked with various
colours, namely, white and green, and russet. In the male
the breast is ruddy, in the female pale. The male sings
in the early spring. The Fringilla nests upon the highest
boughs of shrubs or on the lowest boughs of treeS‚ and
fashions its nest inwardly of wool and outwardly of moss.

OF THE MONTIFRINGILLA.

Ὀροσπίζης, montifringilla, in English a bramlyng, in
German eyn rowert.

ARISTOTLE.

The Montifringilla is like the Fringilla, and similar
in size, but with a blue neck; and it lives in mountains,
whence it has its name.

The little bird which Ι believe to be the Montifringilla,
in size and shape of body is like the Fringilla, but the male
has blue feathers upon the neck, which one cannot perceive
so quickly in the hen. The beak is yellow‚ and the wings
in truth are marked with various colours, yellow‚ black and
white, as in the Aurivittis. Its note is unmelodious and
grating.

2 Shell-apple, or Apple-sheiler is still a Northumbrian name for the

Chaffinch. The word ‘sheld' may mean ‘ parti-coloured.’
3 Here Turner’s mistaken etymology (Fringilla afrzssgore) is evident.
