Α tricapilla-—Bubo 4 7

there any difference between the two, save that of
colour and of voice. That the bird is the same is
evident, since, while this kind is undergoing the
change, each of the two is seen, not fully changed
as yet, and neither having so far any proper name.
Thus far Aristotle.

In England I have never seen the Atricapilla‚ nor yet
but once in life, and that in Italy within the house of the
Duke of Ferrara. And Don Francisco of the Holy Council
of the Duke, a man uncommonly well versed in both the
tongueS, shewed it to me himself. The bird was like the
English lingett and the German grasmuschen‚ so far as size
of body went: but it had a black head, and the remaining
colour of its body verging more to grey.

OF THE Busso.

Βύας, bubo, in English alyke foule, in German eyn schus-
fauss (eyn sch'tiffel)‚ eyn kautZ.

ARISTOTLE.

The Bubo is of the race of Noctuae. and is in
aspect very like a Noctua, but not less than an
Aquila in size.

PLINV.

The Bubo is a fatal bird, of evil omen beyond
other sorts. especially at public auguries; it lives in
desert places, and not merely those that are un-
peopled, but those also hard of access: monster of
the night it utters not a* song, but only a groan. It
never flies where it intendS, but is borne off aslant.
So Pliny says,

This bird Ι saw at Venice once, of a full Eagle's size¹‚

its legs however, were a little shorter than an Eagle’s legs
are wont to be. But it was like an Eagle otherwise.

¹ Turner probably meant the Eagle Owl (Buba {gnavus-ji.
