V ireo— Upupa 1 7 5

Ι have never seen the Vireo in England‚ so far as 1 know,
but very often when in Germany. It is a little smaller than
the Turtur. It gives forth a note like that of the large pipe
which plays the bass part of a song. This bird suspends
its nest upon a branch at the top of a tree, and fashions it in

rounded form, that it should not afford access to any man or
beast.

OF THE UPUPA.

ἔποψ, upupa, in English a howpe, in German eyn houp or
eyn widhopff.

ARISTOTLE.

The Upupa builds its nest chiefly of human dung.
It changes its appearance in the summer season and in
winter, as very many other wild birds do. The Upupa
only of its kind builds not a nest, but entering the

trunks of trees lays eggs in eavities, without any
litter.

Nearly all British writers name that bird Upupa, which
from the noise of its wings foreigners call VanneHus, though
in their own tongue the former call it Lapwing. Yet their
gross error may be easily refuted on the authority of Pliny,
who thus writes of the Upupa.

The Upupa (he says) is a bird filthy otherwise as
to its food, but to be noticed for its folding erest,
which it contracts and then erects again along its

head.

These are his very words. And yet our scholars may be
well excused this their mistake, for nowhere in the whole
of Britain is the Upupa to be found (so far as I know),
though in Germany it is most plentiful. The bird is of the
bigness of a Thrush, with wings barred here and there with
brown, and marked with black and white feathers; the erest
extends from the part of the bill which joins the head to the
extremity of the occiput, along the length, this it contracts
