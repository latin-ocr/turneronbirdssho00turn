Florus—F ulica 7 5

OF THE FLonus FROM ARISTOTLE.

The Anthos, that is Florus, feeds on worms; its
size is that of the Fringilla. It gets victual round
waters and marshes; its colour is fair, and its lise
easy to it. It holds the Horse in hatred‚ inasmuch
as it is driven by the Horse from the grassy pastures
where it feeds. It is purblind and nowise keen of
eyesight, while it imitates the neighing of the Horse,
and flying at it puts the Horse to ssight, yet sometimes
it is caught and then killed by the Horse. The Florus
has so great a hatred of the AEgithus that it is stated
that the blood of these two birdS, even when dead,
cannot be mixed.

OF THE FULICA.

Κὲπφος, fulica, in English a white semaw, with a black
cop, in German eyn wyss mewe.

The later Greeks, who have written after Aristode, have
made the Larus and the Cepphus the same bird, which fact
Erasmus in his Proverb λάρος κέπφος shews, from Aristo-
phanes and his interpreter. But Aristotle in the eighth book
of his History of Animals keeps the two birds distinct, using
the following words:—“ There is the λάρος that is white, also
the κέπφος.” Now in what way to reconcile these authors
Ι know not, unless I say that poets who observe more
negligently than philosophers the peculiar properties of
things, and their diversities, have made these birds the same,
which are alike in form of body, breeding-time, and way of
feeding‚ although differing in manifest respects, whereas philo-
sophers, more strict than they, gauging all things exactly,
have distinguished them as different kinds.

And yet there is not less diversity of opinion among
the critics of our day about the Fulica⁷ and what that bird
may be, than there was controversy among the Greeks about
its name. For there are teachers of a sort1 in Lower
