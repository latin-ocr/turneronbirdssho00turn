Graculi— G rus 95

And now, that you may know what sort of bird the
Switzers' Vllaltrapus may be. which Ι conjecture is the Phala-
crocorax, and the third kind of Graculus, it is a bird long
in the body, which is rather less than that of the Ciconia,
and the legs short but stout, the bill reddish, a little hooked‚
and six inches in length—further it had a white spot on the
head, and that, unless my memory fails me, bare. If it be
web-sooted and swim at times, I should affirm that it un-

Rhetians have given the name of Nucifraga, from the nuts
which it breaks with its bill and eats.

Others come almost from earth's utmost parts,
as do the Grues, which come from the Scythians
to the Egyptian marshes, whence the Nile Hows
forth: in which place they are said to fight with
Pygmies. And this is no mere fable, but assuredly
there is, as it is said, a dwarf race both of men and
horses. and they live in caveS, whence they have got
the name of Troglodytae, from dwelling in caves,
The Grues furthermore clo many things with prudence.
for they seek for their convenience distant places, and

fly high that they may look out far, and, if they shall
