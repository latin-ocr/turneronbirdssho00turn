Gallz'nago—Colz'us ον Οαζξιιίιις 89

Woodcocks are never seen with us save in the winter,
wherefore I have naught to say about their young or mode of
nesting. They are chiefly caught in England in the woods
at daybreak and at dusk‚ by means of nets hung in some
place devoid of treeS, and dropped when the bird comes,

OF THE COLIUS‚ oa GALGULUS, As GAZA RENDERS
1T, FROM ARISTOTLE.

Of the Galgulus the size is almost that of the
Turtur: it is yellowish in colour, and hacks timber
very much, and for the most part feeds on trees: it
utters a loud cry. This bird is mainly an inhabitant
of the Peloponnese.

All that Aristotle has so far attributed to the Colius
or Galgulus is in agreement with the Huhol of the English
and the Grunspecht of the Germans (if one may except its
being chiefly an inhabitant of the Peloponnese). For it is
nearly equal to the Turtle—Dove in size3 it hacks the timber,
hammers rotten wood, and utters a loud cry. But Ι give no
decision here, Ι only ask. The Galgulus of Pliny is said to be
called the Icteros in Greek, and if we trust to Theodorus [Gaza]
is also the κελεός of Aristotle. Though, on consulting the
Greek text κολιὸς seemed to be one bird, and κελεὸς1 another,
for the reading was ;-κολιός ἐστι ξυλοκόπος σφόδρα, καὶ
νέμεται ἐπὶ τῶν ξύλων τὰ πολλά. That is, the Colius iS
especially a wood-hunter and for the most part feeds on
wood‚ ὁ μὲν νγὰρ tce->2659 παρὰ ποταμὸν οἰκεῖ καὶ λόχμας,
which words Theodorus renders “around the thickets and
the groves,” but whether rightly so or otherwise I leave
to be decided by the learned. In the Alps I saw sitting
upon a fir a bird of the size of a Turtle-Dove‚ marked as
it secmed with green patches on yeHow, which to me in the
whole aspect of the body called to mind the Picus Martius,
save that its head was like in colour to the rest of its body

1 Turner appears to have had a text with the word κελεὸς in one place
instead of κολιός.
