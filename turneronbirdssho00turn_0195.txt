Tetrao— Tyrannus 169

ing. There is no other bird, except the Struthio-
camelus, which attains so great a weight of body,
growing to such a size that it may even be caught
upon the ground. The Alps produce them, as do
northern lands. In mews they lose their flavour.
They die of stubbornness by holding back their
breath. Very near them are those which Spaniards
call “Aves tardce'’ and Greece “Otides'’; they are
condemned as food. For when the marrow issues
from the bones, disgust at the smell follows there
and then¹.

OF THE TYRANNUS.

Tyrannus, in English a nyn murder, in German eyn neun
murder or eyn gold hendlin.

ARISTOTLE.

The‘ Tyrannus also lives on worms2. Its body is
but little larges than a locust's is. This little bird
moreover has a somewhat upright crest of reddish
feathers‚ and is otherwise pretty; its song is sweet.

Though Aristotle makes but one kind of Tyrannus, yet
the bird-catchers of Cullen state that there are three. The first
they call die grosse neun murder, which the English name
the Schric for their part, this Ι take to be the Molliceps of
Aristotle. In fflze it equals the sturnus, while its colour verges
from blue to grey. The second kind is of the same colour
as the foregoing, but in size does not exceed a Sparrow.
Furthermore this kind is cruel towards other birds. The
third kind, which is Aristotle’s Tyrannus, is a small bird
which is little bigger than the Regulus, adorned with a red
erest and not unlike the other kinds (if it be right to trust
the fowlers) in its haunts and form of body. It has not ever
happened to me hitherto in England to observe the second or
the third kind of Tyrannus and, although the first exists in
England‚ it is known to very few. Yet there are some who
know it and who call it Shric.
