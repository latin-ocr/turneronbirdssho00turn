Introduction xi

Gaza of Thessalonica, the most celebrated Scholar of his day,
who, fleeing from the sack of Constantinople, played a con-
spicuous part in the rise of the “New Learning,” and after a
course of teaching in Rome, entered successively the service
of the Popes Nicholas the Fifth and Sixtus the Fourth,
eventually dying in poverty in Lucania about 1484.

Exact transcription of a text was considered by no means
necessary in those days: consequently we find many obser-
vations and explanations inserted in the text of Aristotle
and Pliny, which had no place in the original ¹.

Resides referring to Gesner, Turner mentions other learned
men by name and occasionally quotes from their works;
while his pages also inform us of many places that he visited.

The following excerpts from Gesner not only give in-
stances of correspondence between him and Turner, but also
shew that the former was accustomed to correct the latter
from his wider knowledge of Ornithology.

Ide [Turnerus] post librum suum de avibus publicatum,
in epistola ad me data, Berniclas siue Brantas (inquit) ex
putridis nauis malis fungorum more nasci, minime fabulosum
esse doctorum δι honestorum uirorum oculata fides mihi per-
suasit. Branta anserem palustrem ualde refert: his tamen
notis ab eo differt. Branta breuior est, a collo quod rubescit
nonnihil, ad medium usq, uentrem, qui candicat, nigra est.
anserum more segetes populatur. ln Vuallia (quae pars est
Angliae) in Hibernia δε Scotia aues istae adhuc rudes ἃ im-
plumes in littore, sed non sine forma certa & propria auis
passim inueniuntur. Et rursus, Praeter brantam aut berniclam
est alia auis, quae originem suam arbori refert acceptam.
Arbores sunt in scotia ad littus maris crescentes, e quibus
prodeunt ueluti fungi parui, primum informes, postea pau—
latim integram auis formam acquirunt, perfectae tandem
magnitudinis illae, rostro aliquantisper pendent, paulo post
in aquam decidunt, & tum demum uiuunt. Hoc tot tantaeq,
integritatis uiri affirmauerunt ut credere audeam, ἃ aliis cre-
dere suadefi. Haec ille. Eliota Anglus &cm

the texts of Aubert and XVimmer, and Sillig respectively.
