Shovelard¹. 5101111115 15 that kind which Englishmcn denomi-
nate buttour or bittour, and the Germans call pittour or
rosdom. Now it 15 a bird like other Herons in its state
of body generally, living by hunting fishes on the banks
of swamps and rivers, very sluggish and most stupid, so that
it can very easily bc driven into ncts by the use of a stalking
horse, 50 far as Ι remember‚ it is nearly of -the colour of
a Pheasant‚ and thc bcak is smcared with mud; 11 1111015
brayings like those of an ass. Of all birds it aims at mens'
eyes most readily. &Vbercforc if anything hinders this kind
from being the Stellaris (which is not yet given to me to see)
it ought to be the Phoix‚ inasmuch as Aristotle testifies that
it aims chiefly at the eyes, though other Ardeae also osten
seem to do the same.

OF THE AURIVITTIS.

Χρυσομίτρις (not as some texts have it ῥυσομήτρης),
aurivittis, in English a gold finchc, in German eyn (115101-
finck or eyn stigelitz.

The Aurivittis is one of the small birds that seed on
sceds of thistles, and do not touch worms even when offered
to them. Some will have it that the Goldfinc 01· 1110 Distel-
vinc is but the Spinus²‚ some the Carduelis. But if anyonc
can shew another of the thistlc-eating birds save this, girt
with 3 golden band, to which the name of Aurivittis is more
fitting 111311 10 11115, Ι gladly will allow my opinion 10 00
ignored, but otherwise, I do not see why it should not be
worthy of approval.

OF THE ATTAGEN.

Ἀττανγὴιι, ἀττάνγας. attagen, attagena.

The Attagen, as Aristotle writes, is like the Gallinago
in colour. And Aristophanes bears witness in these lines
that the Attagena is marked with varied spots :-—

“If any of you be a runaway and brandcd with the
marks, he shall assuredly be called with us the spotted
Attagen.'‘

¹ That is, the Spoonbill of modern books (Platalca lencm-odia), while
the buttour is os course the Bittern (Botaurus stellaris)

2 Turner himself considered Spinus to be the Greenfinch (cf. p. ὃς os
the original).
