Rubecula-Ruticz‘lla ι 5 7

All that Aristotle here has written of these two birds
Pliny has copied from him into his own work. But in this
matter each of them, relying on the tales of sowlers more than
on his own experience, has wandered greatly from the path
of truth. For both the birds are seen at the same time:
moreover tame Rubeculae‚ when fed in cages, constantly
retain the same appearance. Moreover Ι have very osten
seen the birds in England nesting at the same time, though
in very different ways. The Rubecula‚ which has a ruddy
breast no less in summer than in winter, nests as far as
possible from towns and cities in the thickest briers and
shrubs aster this fashion. &Vhere it finds oak leaves in plenty,
or leaves like the oak, it builds its nest among the leaves
themselves close to the roots of briei-s or the thicker shrubs :
and when completed covers it with leaves as if with topiary
work. Nor does access lie open to the nest on every side,
but by one way alone is entrance gained. And at that place
where it enters the nest the bird builds a long porch of leaves
before the doorway and, on going forth to seed, closes the
end with leaves. But, what Ι now describe, Ι first observed
when quite a boy, nevertheless 1 am not going to deny that
it may build otherwise. If any have observed another way
of nesting, let them tell it, and they certainly will not a little
gratisy the students of such things, myself among the first.
I have imparted truthfully to others what I saw.

The Phoenicurus which he [Gaza] calls the Rubicilla nests
in hollow trees and (as I often have had experience) in chinks
and craeks of walls and outhouses in the midst of our towns,
though where the throng of rnen is not so great. The male
has a black head, a red tail, but otherwise is like the
female, save that he repeatedly utters a little song. Either
sex flirts the tail continually. The female phoenicurus and
its brood are so much like young of Rubecula that they
can scarcely be distinguished by the sharpest eye. But
by the motion of the tail they may be recognised. For the
Rubeculaz, although they move the tail, yet, after they have
lowered it, at once raise it again, nor does it quiver twice
or thrice as does that os the Ruticilla. For no sooner have
the Ruticillae once begun to move the tail than they go on
till they have lightly moved it three or four times altogether
