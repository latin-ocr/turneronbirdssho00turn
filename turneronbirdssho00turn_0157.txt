ΟΕ Thia: OTUS.

‹13-r69,otus‚ in English a horn owl, in German eyn ranseul
or eyn schlcier eul.

Aius’ro'rLE.

The Otus is like a Noctua, furnished with little
tufts sticking out near the ears, whence it has got its
name, as though one should say “eared.'’ Some call
it Ulula, and others Asio. It is a babbler and a mis-
chievous rogue, and is a mimie too, sor when men dance
it imitates their ways. It is caught while intent upon
one of two bircl-catclier8‚ the other circumventing it.

OF THE Oris FROM PLINY.

Next to the Tetraones come those birds, which
Spain calls “Aves tardze'’ and Greece “Otides,'‘
condemned as food for man. For when the marrow
issues from the bones. disgust at the smell follows
there and then.
