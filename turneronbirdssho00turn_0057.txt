strength; it passes its life round lakes. By pools
it chases water-birds, which dive from time to time,
until it catches thern sleepy and weary. The con-
test is a sight to see, the quarry seeking refuge
on the shore, chiefly where reeds are thick, and
thence the Aquila drives it away with a stroke of
the wing and plunges in the lake as it swoops from
above, shewing its shadow to the bird as it swims
under water from the shore. Again the latter tries
a different place and comes up where it thinks that
it will least be marked. This is the cause of birds
swimming in flocks, for they are not molested when
in companieS, and blind their enemy by splashing with
their wings. The Aquilae themselves, moreover, often
are immersed, not being able to support the weight
that they have clutched. Thus Pliny.

All things that Aristotle and Pliny have attributed to
the bird Percnos so sar well agree with the Balbushard of
the English1, if one may except its size alone, and if the
rest be present, that perhaps should not stand in the way.
Now the bird which I apprehend to be the Anataria, being
bigger and longer than the Buteo, with a white patch upon
the head, and nearly fuscous in colour, always haunts the
banks of rivers, pools, and swamps; it lives by hunting
Ducks and those black fowls which Englishmen call Couts.
The conflict of which Pliny makes mention above between
this Eagle (if it should be called an Eagle) and the water-birds
Ι have seen often, and not I alone, but countless Englishmen
witness it daily. If anywhere a little space of ground rises
among the reed-beds, there the bird is wont to make a nest,
that, since in power of ssight it is not very strong, it may
not be far distant from its prey. It suddenly attacks birds,
and thus takes thern. It also sometimes butchers coneys.
Now whether this may be the Anataria or not I put it to the
learned to decide.
