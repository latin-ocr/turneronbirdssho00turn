Onocrotalns— Orlygomelra 1 2 7

its beak into the water it gives utterance to such a booming
as may easily be heard an Italian mile away. It gorges
fishes and especially eels most greedily, nor is there any
bird, except the Mergus, that devours more. Now what
resemblance has it to a Swan? Distinctly none that brings
itself in view before our eyes. Now in the eleventh chapter
of Leviticus Moses enumerates the Onocrotalus next to the
Swan among the unclean birds. And a suspicion has arisen
thence, not undeservedly‚ within a certain class, that some-
where within Gaul or Judaea a bird of Swan—like form may
possibly exist. If such, however, nowhere can be found, it
seems likely that l'liny either was deceived by lying story-
tellers or he understood that which he has related of the
similarity between the Onocrotalus and Cygnus to refer to
a resemblance not of body, but of voice. For even Swans
utter at certain times booms not unlike the braying of an
ass: but short, and which cannot be heard afar. However
if men of deep and varied learning by their votes shall not
approve this rendering of mine, at least they will agree with
me that the said bird is Aristotle's Ardea Stellaris, For
to omit the rest, which I have touched upon above, that
author certainly gives countenance to my opinion when he
shews a tale to have existed that the Ardea Stellaris from
a slave was turned into a bird. For as the skin of an
absconding slave, caught subsequent to flight, stricken with
thongs, whips, rods and knotted ropes, becomes all mottled
with the wales of stripeS‚ so too the feathers of this bird
are marked, and painted as it were, with mottlings of black
in every part, though chiefly on the back, and thus may well
recall to us the skin of slaves cut up with whips. And that
this thing gave rise to the aforesaid tale, 1 gather from the
fact that Aristophanes, author of various plays, writes of
the Attagen, a bird very like ours so far as colour of the
feathers goes, to this effect :—

“ If any of you be a runaway, and branded with the marks, with us
assuredly he shall be called the spotted Attagen.”
