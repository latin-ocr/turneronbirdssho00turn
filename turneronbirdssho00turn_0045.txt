A lcedo 2 1

Kingfishers, of which there are two sorts‚ is fond of
watersides: one is a vocal bird, which sits on reeds,
the other, which is of a larger size, is mute. The
back is blue in both. The Kingfisher, however, also

haunts the sea.

This bird is little bigger than the Passer, for the
most part blue in colour‚ with the wings alone of
purple mixed with white, and with a long and slender
neck. Each of the two kinds may be distinguished
by its size and voice. The lesser sing in seed-beds.
It is very rare to see the Halcyon, and this occurs
only towards the setting of the Pleiades and near the
solstice or in winter-time, when, after circling round
the ship awhile, it hurriedly departs again to its
retreat. They breed in winter, at the season called
the Halcyon days ¹, wherein the sea is calm and fit for
navigation, the Siciliam sea particularly so. Elsewhere
indeed the ocean is less boisterous. The Sicilian is
certainly gentle enough. Now these birds build their
nests in the seven days before the winter solstice,
and hatch out their young in the seven following.
Their nests cornpel our wonder, of a ball-like shape,
with a small jutting part and very narrow hole,
like sponges of great si2e; they cannot be cut open
with an iron tool, but may be broken by a vigorous
blow, as dry sea-foan12 may be. It is not known
of what these are composed. Some think of pointed
bones, since the birds live on fish. They also dive
in rivers, and lay five eggs each.

¹ For the origin of this ancient tradition, the reader may be referred
to any work dealing with Greek mythology.
2 By ‘dry sea-foam' Pliny probably meant masses of whelks' eggs.
