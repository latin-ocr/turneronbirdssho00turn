A nas—A nser 23

Besides the two kinds thus described by Aristotle and
Pliny I know of a bird, of which, if it should not be properly
ascribed to the Kingfisher tribe, I really cannot say under
what head it ought to go. It is a little smaller than
a Starling, with the body wholly black, except sor a white
belly, and it has the tail comparatively short, the beak a little
shorter than the Kingfisher. Before a ssight it dips repeatedly‚
after the manner of the Kingfisher‚ and cries out as it flies;
it is so like the Kingfisher in voice that, if you did not see
it, you would swear it was a Kingfisher. I have observed
it on the banks of streams not far from the sea-side, but
nowhere else. It lives on little fishes, like the aforesaid kinds
of Kingfishers I never saw its nest. The inhabitants of
Morpeth, where I saw the bird, call it a water craw¹.

OF THE ANAs.

Νῆττα, anas, in English a duck, in German eyn endt.

PLINY.

Anates only, and birds of like kind, rise in the
air at once, and make straight for the sky, and that
even from the water.

OF THE ANSER.

Χήν, anser, in English a goose, in German eyn ganSS.

Aristotle agrees with Pliny in making two chief kinds of
Geese, the latter separating them into the greater and the
less, the former into tame and wild. But Pliny tells us that
besides these two chief kinds of Geese, there are of the
Goose kind Penelopes and Chenalopeces, as one text has it,
as another goeS‚ Chenalopeces and CheneroteS. The first
reading stands thus :—

1 The bird meant is undoubtedly the Water Ousel or Dipper (Cinclus
aquaticus), which still goes by the name of Water Craw in the north of
England. It is curious that Turner should never have seen its nest when
he was in Northumberland.
