Rnbz'cilla—Salus 1 6 1

OF THE RUBICILLA.

Πυῤῥούλαςῑ, rubicilla, in English a bulfinche, in German
eyn blodtfinck.

Aristotle counts the Rubicilla among those birds which
seed on worxns: but he does not describe it in more words.
I, following the derivation of the name, conjecture that it is
the Bulfinc of the English and the bloudvinc of the Germans.
For of all the birds I ever saw the male of this kind has by sar
the reddest breast: the female however has the breast wholly
grey, though otherwise like the male. But, that all may
understand more easily about which bird I write, it is the
size of a Spanow, with the beak particularly short and broad
and black, the tongue much broader than isin proportion to its
body. That part of the tongue which discriminates the flavour
of the sood and meets the palate of the mouth is flesh-
coloured and naked‚ while the other parts are covered with
a horny pellicle. Bluish grey feathers clothe the upper parts.
The tail is black and the head also black. It feeds rnost
greedily on those earliest buds, which burst out on the trees
before the leaves and flowers, as well as hemp-seed. It is the
readiest bird to leam, and imitates a pipe very closely with
its voice. It nests in hedges where it lays four eggs or five at
most. It keeps the same colour throughout the year, and
does not change its home. And since these things are so, it
cannot be the Atricapilla, as some will have it, though it
may appear to lael< the point at the tip of the tongue.

OF THE Suus, wfflcn IN GREEK 1s CALLED αἴὙιθος.
ARISTOTLE.

The Salus is well thought of for its skill in gaining
a livelihood‚ and for the number of its young, although
it suffers from lameness in one of its feet. And men
deny that the blood of the Salus and the Florus ever
mixes, for so great an enmity rages between the birds.
There is war also between the Salus and the Ass,

¹ Sundevall thinks that the Πυῤῥούλας is the Redbreast, but the de-
scription does not agree with his idea. Another reading is πυρρουράς.
