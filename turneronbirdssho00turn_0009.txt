PREFACE.

N translating this treatise it has been thought

advisable to adhere as closely as possible to the
original text of Turner, though in many places a more
modern style of phraseology would doubtless have
better pleased the ear of the non-scientific reader.

Not a few difficult points of interpretation have
arisen in'the course of the work, and the Editor
welcomes this opportunity of expressing his gratitudo
to Professor Newton and to Mr R. D. Archer-Hind
of Trinity College for the invaluable help that he has
received from them in elucidating the hard passages
and in revising the proofs. The Editor's thanks are
also due to the Syndics of the University Press for
undertaking the present publication.
