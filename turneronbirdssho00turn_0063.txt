A rdea 39

A 1<1s'1·o'r1.E.

Of Ardeae there are three kinds, Pella, Alba, and
Stellaris‚ but the last 1135 1116 by-name of Piger. The
coupling of Pella is difficult‚ for it screams while it
couples and (they say) emits blood from its eyes: it
also brings forth painfully and with extreme (11511655.
The Pella is sagacioris, quick at getting food¹, and
always busy. It is wont to be astir by day; yet it
is mean in colour, with the belly wet. Of the re-
maining two the Alba, fair of colour, couples, nests
and brings forth well; it feeds in marshes, on a lake,
in fields and meadow-ground. But the Stellaris‚ by-
named Lazy (in the fable it is said of old to have
been changed from a slave to a bird), as its by-narne
imports, is slow and indolent. The bird called Phoix
has beyond all others this peculiarity that it especially
attacks the eyes. The Ardea and the Albardeola,
which is of smaller size and has 3 broad and elongated
bill, seek lakes and rivers.

The Pella builds its nest in England 011 1116 lofty trees
that grow not far from the banks of streams. The upper
part of the body is blue, the lower is, however, sornewhat
white. It routs Eagles or Hawks, if they attack it suddenly,
by very liquid mutings of the belly, and thereby defends
itself. Of this kind I have seen some white, though they are
rare, which differed from the aforesaid neither in their size
nor shapc of body, but in 6010111 only. Furthermore the
white has been observed in England 10 nest with the blue,
and to bear offspring. Wherefore it is clear that they are
of one species, Ι have only once seen—and that was in
Italy—the Albardeola, which is called λευκερωδιός 111 Greek3
it is much smaller than the Pella and by no means shuns the
sight of man so much as does the blue. Had I not seen it,
1 should have declared the Albasdeola 10 be the English

¹ That is, for its young.
