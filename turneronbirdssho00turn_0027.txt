E pistle Dedz'catory

To the most illustrious Prince of WaleS‚
Edward‚ son and heir of the most serene
and mighty Henry VIII, King of Eng-
land, France and Ireland‚ William Turner
wishes long life and health.

XCEEDING wise, and if I understand aright,
necessary above all things, most illustrious
Prince‚ was the warning of the royal prophet, in which
he admonished kings, princes, and judges of the earth
that they should have understanding and seek learn—
ing. For, as that architect supreme of the universe,
God most good and great, placed the head above all
the remaining parts of the body in man, who in him-
self shews forth the image of a most perfect State,
and stored up in it all the five senses at once, that it
should see, hear, taste‚ and smell for all the remaining
members (to which touch alone has been allowed),
and should consult for their well-being; so he hath
set the Prince, as it were a head, over the State,
a body welded together of many members, that he
should provide for the advantage and well-being of
the whole State by his wisdom, learning and senses,
not so much externa] as internal. No one demands
sight in the feet. hearing in the legs, smell1 in the
hands, or smell in the arms; but all these things are
necessary in the head.

¹ This should probably be “taste'' (gustum).
