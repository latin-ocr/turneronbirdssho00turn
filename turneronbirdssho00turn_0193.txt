OF THE TINNUNCULUS.

Κεγχρίς, tinnunculus, in English a kistrel or a kastrel‚ or
a steingall.

ARISTOTLE.

All birds with crooked claws¹ breed somewhat
sparingly, save the Tinnunculus, and it of all the
crooked-claw kind lays the most eggs. For of this
bird four young have been already found, while it is
evident that more might be produced. The stomach
in Tinnunculus is not unlike a crop, whereas it is the
only one of all the crooked-claw kind that drinks. Its
eggs are red—like scarlet.

The Tinnunculus is of a much more fulvous colour than
are other Hawks, and small in body. It chases little birds,
and, as some men have told me, butterflies at times. It nests
in hollow trees, church wall& and lofty towers, as I have
seen in Germany at Strassburg and at Cullen, and in England
at Morpeth. It also feeds its young long after they can fly
until such time as they can live apart by hunting for them-
selves.

OF THE TETRAo.

Τέτριξ, οὖραξ, tetrao, in English a bustard or a bistard‚ in
German eyn tr'ap or eyn trap gainss.

A RISTOTLE.

The Tetrix‚ which Athenians call the Urax, trusts
its nest not to the ground, nor to a tree, but to low-
growing plants.

PLINY.

Their glossy plumage well becomes the Tetraones,
as does furthermore their perfect blackness and the
scarlet redness of their eyebrows. But one kind
exceeds in size the vultures and recalls their colour-
