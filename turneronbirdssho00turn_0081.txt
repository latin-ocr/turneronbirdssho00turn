beak is slender and is slightly hooked towards the tip3 it
never rests, but is for ever climbing up the trunks of ‘trees
after the manner of the WVoodpeckers, and it eats grubs,
picking them from the bark.

OF THE CICONIA.

Πελαρνγός, ciconia, in English a stork‚ in German eyn
storck, and in Saxon eyn ebeher.

The Stork, though one of the best known of birds among
the Germans, is to nearly all my countrymen of Britain as
unknown as the most unknown bird. And little wonder
since a Stork is nowhere to be seen, save as 3 captive,
in our island. With the Germans the bird nests upon roofs
or even chimney tops at times. It is 3 bird of middle size
between 3 Crane and 3 Heron and distinguished by feathers
of black and white: it has long legs and 3 beak like
3 Cmne’s, but red and stout ; it lives near lakes and marshes,
eating frogS‚ toads, snakes and fishes.

PLINY ΟΝ CICONJAE.

From what parts the Ciconiae may come, or whither
they betake themselveS, is not yet ascertained. It is
indubitable that they come from far in the same
manner as the Grues, but the former arrive in winter
and the latter in summer. When ready to depart these
birds collect at some fixed place, and aster gathering,
so that none of their tribe, unless a prisoner or a
slave, is left behind, they disappear, on an appointed
day, as if by law. No one has ever seen the whole
array in very act to go, though it may haply shew
itself when ready to depart; nor do we view it
coming, but when it has come. Both these events
take place at night. Ciconiae seek the same nests
again, and tend their parents in old age.

OF THE CINCLUS.

ΚίὙκλος, ἦ σεισοπυγίς, in English a water swallow, in
German eyn steynbisser.
