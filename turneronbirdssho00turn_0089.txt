C olumbz'—- Catu rnix 6 3

Οἰνάς, in Latin called Vinag0‚ has never met my eye up
to this time, nor have I yet found out what name it bears
among our countrymen or among Germans. But I have seen
doves in Venice half as big again as those of our own land,
although Ι do not think that they could be Vinagines, but
birds brought to those parts out of Campania, where Pliny
notes the Doves to be cxceeding large.

OF THE COTURNIX.

ὄρτυξ, coturnix, in English a quale, in German eyn
wachtel.

PLINY.

The Coturnix is a little bird, and, when it comes
to us, keeps on the ground more than alost. Yet
it flies hither just as Grues and Ciconiae, not without
danger to sea—faring men, when they approach the
land. For these birds often settle on the sails, and
that always at night, and so sink ships. The seed
of Veratrum, or, as others read, Venenum, is a very
grateful food to the Coturnices, and for this cause
men have condemned them for the table; further-
more it is the custom for thern to be spurned on
account of the falling sickness, to which, they alone
of animals, save man, are subject.

Now since these things are 5ο, I marvel much what evil
genius put it into the mind of my fellow Britons to esteem
them thus among their delicacies, when their flesh is liable to
ills so many, namely poison and the falling sickness. The
Quail is like the Partridge⁷ although many times smaller.
As Aristotle writes it claims a property peculiar to it of

having both crop and gullet large and wide near to the
stomach.
