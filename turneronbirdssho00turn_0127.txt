short this little bird is rare. The Apodes, which some
call Cypselli‚ are like Hirundines, as has been said
before. for they are not to be distinguished frorn the
Hirundo, save by having hairy legs. The nest which
they construet looks like a little basket formed of mud
somewhat drawn out, an entrance of the straitest
opening beneath; and this they place in cracks within
the rocks and caves, that they may avoid both beasts
and men.

PLINv.

The birds which, because they cannot use their feet,
are called Apodes, live chiefly on the wing. They
are named Cypselli by some, in aspect they are like
HirundineS. They nest in crags. These are they
which are seen on all parts of the sea, nor do
ships ever leave the land upon so long or so con-
tinuous a course but that the Apodes still fly around
thern. The other kinds alight and settle, but for
these there is no rest save in their nests alone, they
either hang or lie. So far Pliny and Aristotle.

Now Aristotle makes only three kinds of Hirundines,
those of the house, the Apodes and the Falculze. Yet
Pliny seems to make four kinds, those of the house, the
Rusticae, the Apodes‚ and the Ripariae. If that be true,
our llouse vaallows, well known from their blood-coloured
breast, will be the first-named kind. Those very large and
black Swallows, that mostly fly in flocks, appear to form the
second kind. Those Swallows which make nests upon the
tops of touoers, and in lofty chureh windows, constitute
the third. And the Riparite or Falcula: will be the fourth.
But should the said division not approve itself‚ then to the
first-named kind may be referred those Swallows which in-
variably build on the houses of the country people. Two
