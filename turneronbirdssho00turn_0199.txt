The Turdi are in winter chiefly seen in Germany.

The first kind of Turdus Englishmen particularly name
a Thrushe, and Germans (if the bird-catchers‚ who taught
me 50 10 6311 11, 16361 1116 1101 astray) eyn crammesvogel.
The second kind the English call a Throssel or a Mavis, but
the Germans say eyn drossel or eyn durstel. The third is
named a WVyngthrushe by the English and eyn weingaerds-
vogel by the Germans. This Turdus has broadish red spots
on each side near the eyes, 35 well as on the breast, and also
both inside and outside at the bend of the wing. But I have
never seen its nest, nor 15 11131 wonderful, since it is nowhere
to be seen with us throughout the summer. The first kind is

unusual. The second kind, with 3 11111611 spotted breast
appears throughout the year, and by many is kept in cages
sor its song. It builds a nest, moreover, inwardly 01 1111161 01
