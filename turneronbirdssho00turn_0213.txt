The well-known Alexander, the greatest and most
renowned of all kings of the nations in power, war—
like glory, and zeal for learning, weighing this in his
mind, presented Aristotle with 480‚ooo crowns, when
he was about to write on animaIS, since he knew that
the philosopher could not carry out that task with
his private means, for the purpose of hiring fowlers
and hunters‚ and for keeping in vivaria the animals
which had been already caught, and provided to that
end. If such an Alexander existed anywhere to-day‚
I should not doubt that a new Aristotle would be born
again for us from somewhere, who not only would
display to us all the anImals, with few excepdons, of
that former Aristode, with their habits, their medicinal
properties, and their latter-day names, but would in-

creatures is to be put down rather to the liberality
of Alexander than to the diligence of Aristotle:
though that too must be praised without stint. For if
the bounty of Alexander had not supplied to Aristotle
those animals to be examined, he never would have
published so complete a History of Animals for us.

day cease to wonder that the histories of plants,
birds, fishes, and quadrupeds are written in this age
with less spirit, less learning, and less diligence than
that with which they were treated in a former age.
To-day whatever of value is brought to light is
published at the private expense of very zealous men
of slender fortunes and printers. But now I return
to you, most ingenuous reader, and beseech you once
and again that, if any bird of foreign aspect meet
