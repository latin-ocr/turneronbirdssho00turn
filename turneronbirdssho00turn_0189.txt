Salus—Silta 1 6 3

because the Ass is wont to rub its sores against the
thorn-bushes to scratch them, therefore for this cause,
and also because the bird has heard the brayer's voice
it prematurely drops its eggs, while even nestlings fall
down to the ground with sear. So for that injury (the
bird) attacking it scoops out its sores.

PLINY.

The AEgsthus, a very little bird, wages war with the
Ass, because it, rubbing against thorn-bushes to scratch
itself, destroys the nest, and this the bird dreads so much
that, if it merely hears the brayer's voice, it drops its
eggs, and the young also fall to the ground with
sear. Accordingly attacking it the bird scoops out
1ts sores,

OF THE SITTA.

sitta, in English a nut jobber‚ in German eyn nushakker
or eyn meyspecht.

ARISTOTLE.

That bird which is called Sitta has pugnacious
habits but a cheerful disposition ; it is elegant and well
adapted to get food with ease. Yet men attribute
witchcraft to it, since it is cunning in knowledge of
affairs; it produces numerous young with ease;
hammering on rotten trees, it lives upon the grubs
which thence it digs. The Sitta breaks the eggs of
the Aquila, on which account, ancl also since it is
carnivorous, the Aquila is its enemy.

The small bird which the English call the Nut-seeker and
Germans the meyspecht is somewhat bigger than the biggest
Parus, with blue plumage and a longish beak. It climbs
trees in the same way as the Picus, and hammers the same
for food; it also bores nuts with its beak‚ and eats the
kernels It nests in hollow trees», as does the Picus, while

its note is very sharp and. loud.
