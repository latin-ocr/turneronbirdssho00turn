Gaza believes, that bird with golden feathers will not be
the Carduelis‚ for with Aristotle that is not the θραυπίς,
but the Chrysomitris„ Therefore I dare not pronounce what
bird the Carduclis is.

OF THE COERULEO.

Κυανός, coeruleo, in English a clot-burd, a smatche, an
arlyng‚ a steinchek, in German eyn brech vegel.

AiusTOTLE.

The Coeruleo chiefly dwells in Scyros and loves
rocks; in size it is a little smaller than a Merula,
a little larger than a Fringilla: it has large feet, and
climbs on rocks: in colour it is blue: the beak is
long and thin: the legs are short as in the Pipo.

The Coerule0¹‚ if it be the bird which I conjecture, nests
in rabbit holes and under stones in England, and does not
appear in winter.

OF THE CERTHIA.

ARISTOTLE.
The Certhia is a very little bird of bold habits:

its home is upon trees, its food is grubs; it shews
wise instinct for the needs of life.

There is a certain bird which Englishmen call Creeper‚
that is Climber‚ for it always climbs about on trees: this
Ι believe to be the Certhia. It is a little bigger than
the Regulus, having a whitish breast‚ the other parts dull
brown, but varied with black spot53 its note is sharp‚ its

¹&Vhatever bird Aristotle’s may be, Turner’s is certainly the
&Vheateain Belon and Gesner seem to think that the former is the
Blue Thrush, but Sundevall is certainly wrong in suggesting that it is
the XVall-Creeper (Tz'clzodrwmz muraria).
