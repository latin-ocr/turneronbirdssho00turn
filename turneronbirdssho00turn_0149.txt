Olor— Onocrolczlns 1 2 3

Aquila successfully, should he begin a fight; and yet,
unless provoked, never induce the fight. These birds
are wont to sing even when just about to die. They
also fly afar over the main, and men ere now, who
have been sailing on the African sea have met with
many singing mournfully and seen some of them die.

Should any one have never seen a Swan, nor learnt
sufficiently what sort of bird it be from this account of
Aristotle, let him know that it is a white bird, much bigger
than a Goosc, though like in form and feeding3 with black
fect, and a bill hardly spindle-shaped¹, reddish in colour;
on the highest part of which, where it adjoins the head,
stands forth a very black and rounded knob, sloping towards

the bill.

OF T11E ONOCROTALUs.

There are many to-day conspicuous among all for learning
to no small degree who maintain that the loud-sounding
lacustrine bird, called Buttor by the English, and l'ittour
or Rosdomm by the Germans, is the Onocrotalus. To whose
opinion Ι would willingly subscribe, (the more so as the
etymology of the bird's name agrees well with its voice‚)
did not the authority of Pliny writing os the Onocrotalus
after this manner <lis-,suade me therefrom.

The Onocrotali, he says·‚ have a similitude to the
Olores, and they do not seem to differ in any way,
save that there is a kind of second belly in the very
jaws. Herein the insatiable animal crams everything
at once, so marvellous is its capacity, and presently,
the plundering complete. it gradually returns all to the
mouth, and thence transfers it to the real belly in the
manner osa ruminant. Northern Gaul, where nearest
to the ocean, sends us these. So sar Pliny.

¹ This passage is not easily rendered, as it is difficult to see what
Turner intended by ‘ turbinato.‘ Turbo is a conical shell, spindle and so

forth; but it is hard to say how a Swan's beak could be considered either
conical or spindle-shaped.
