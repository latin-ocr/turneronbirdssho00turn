Introduction i x

Turner married jane, daughter of George Ander, Alder-
man of Cambridge, by whom he had issue Winifred, Peter and
Elizabeth. ”

It must be understood that, his scientific work apart‚
nearly the whole of Turner's life was spent in religious
controversy, and he published a considerable number of
polemical works, the titles of which may be seen in the
bibliography appended to the excellent ‘Life' prefixed to
Mr Jackson’s facsimile reprint of the Libellus dc re herbaria ¹,
whence all the particulars above given are taken. Other
‘lists of Turner's works may be found in Cooper's Athenae
Cantabrzgz'euscs (Ι. pp. 257—259) and the Dz‘ctionmy of
Natz'mlal Biograplcy(LV11. pp. 365, 366).

Turner's object in writing the present treatise is fully set
forth in his ‘Epistola Nuncupatoria’ prefixed to it. While
attempting to determine the principal kinds of birds named
by Aristotle and Pliny, he has added notes from his own
experience on some species which had come under his
observation, and in so doing he has produced the first book
on Birds which treats them in anything like a modern
scientific spirit ancl not from the medical point of view
adopted by nearly all his predecessors; nor is it too much
to say that almost every page bears witness to a persona]
knowledge of the subject, which would be distinctly creditable
even to a modern ornithologist.

This knowledge is especially evident in his account of the
habits of the Hobby (p. 19), Hen-Harrier (p. 19), VVater-
Ousel (p. 23), Moor-Buzzard (p. 33), Osprey (p. 37), Godwit
(p. 45), VVheatear (p. 53), Sandpiper (p. 57), Fieldsare (p. 59),
Cuckoo (p. 69), Black-headed Gull (p. 77), Black Tern
(p. 79), Swallows (p. 101), Cormorant (p. 111). shrike (p. 119),
Redbreast and Redstart (p. 157); while his keen eye for
distinctions is shown in his descriptions of the Black Cock
and Grey Hen (p. 43), Godwit (p. 45), Tree-Creeper (p. 53),
