fore, the Bass Goose of the Scots, which has its nest
and eggs on the Bass, a Scottish Isle, and thence takes its
name. Now when at a certain season of the year the
Geese are about to return to this precipitous island rock—
not so big on the top as a Kite could hover over (as the
Poet has said), but very small—it would be too long to
recount what spying‚ what circumspection (scouts having been
sent ahead) they use before they alight: at what time of year
they do this, the solitary state of the isle, when the inhabit-
ants shut themselves up for several days, until the Geese
have settled down, lest they should drive them off, in what
numbers and in what a throng they fly to it, so that in clear
weather they obscure the sun, how many fishes they bring
home, how many eggs they lay, and what profit the dwellcrs
in the isle make annually from the feathers and the oil of these
Geese (for they possess the fatness and the taste of Pupins).

OF THE INDIAN DUCK.

There is among us, a Duck from India, with exactly the
same form of body, the same beak and foot as the common
bird, but bigger by half and heavier. Its head is red as
blood, as is a good part of the adjoining neck behind. The
whole of this is callous flesh and marked with fissures: and
where it ends at the nostrils it makes a caruncle like that in
Swans, separated in form from the rest of the fiesh, which
joins the beak. The head and red part of the neck are
devoid of featherS, save that on the top of the head is a white
seathery erest, extending over the whole length of the head3
and this the bird erectS, when it is excited. Under the eyes
to the beginning of the beak at its lower part irregular black
spots are arranged on the flesh: and one or two reach upward
from the top of the eye to the parts above. The eye is
yellowish, being separated by a black ring from the rest of
the head. Close behind the eye is a solitary mark, apart
from the rest. The whole beak is blue save that at the tip
one spot shews black. The plumage over all the rest of the
neck is white. Where the neck joins the body, there is a
ring of black feathers spotted and irregular—with an occa-
sional white one—narrower below, broader above. Behind
this the plumage is white over the whole of the belly below:
