birds; so that he had once had six she-goats blinded
by Caprimulgi, but that one and all they now had flown
away from Switzerland to Lower Germany, where nowadays
they did not only steal the milk of she-goats‚ making them go
blind, but killed the sheep besides. And, on my asking the
bird's name, he said that it was called the Paphus, otherwise
the Priest. But possibly that aged man was jesting with
me. Yet whether he was jesting, or spoke gravely, still
I have no other German name than what he gave to me for
Caprimulgus. If there be any then who have in readiness
a better or a fitter name than this, let them produce it.

OF THE CARDUELIS.

The Carduelis, if we believe Gaza, is in Greek called
θραυπίς. Aristotle also numbers it among small thistle-

eaters1. I find in Aristotle nothing more than this about
the Carduelis. Pliny writes that cardueles, smallest of all
birds, perform set tasks, and not in song alone, but with their
feet and beak in place of hands.

Besides that thistle-eating little bird2 adorned with band
of gold I know another thistle-eating sort, in colour greenss,
which with its beak takes up its food from one of two small
buckets moving up and down alternately, its water from
the other, as the Aurivittis does The Miliaria moreover
does the same, which bird our countrymen call Linot.
Furthermore it mimics with its song a man when singing
anything. And so it is not only that one kind, in Greek
called θραυπίς and in Latin named by Theodorus4 Carduelis
that performs the tasks that it is bid, and uses beak and
feet in place of hands

It seems to me then difficult to say, since all three birds
seed upon thistle-seeds‚ which of them Pliny meant by
Carduelis‚ whether it should be the Thraupis, or the Acanthis,
or the Chrysomitris. And should it be the ThraupiS‚ as
