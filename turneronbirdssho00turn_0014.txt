Χ Introduction

Doves (p. 59), Lapwing (p. 77), Nutcracker (p. 95), Reed-
Bunting (p‘. 103), Kites (p. 117), Bullfinch (p. 161) and others.
He is most careful to tell us whether he observed the various
species in England or abroad and their comparative abund-
ance, and to note the breeding of the rarer species, such as
the Spoonbill (p. 151), and Crane (p. 97) within our islands—
that of the Crane being of special interest ; the whole account
of the Cuckoo (p. 69) is also most noticeable‚ as is that
of the curious WVaIt-rapp (p. 95) of which Gesner writes as
follows:

GESNER De Corvo Sylvatz‘co1 (p. 7337).

AUIS, cuius hic effigies habetur, a nostris nominatur uulgo
ein LValdrapp3 id est coruus sylvaticus...Sunt qui phalacro—
coracem hanc auem interpretentur, quoniam & magnitudine
ἃ colore fere coruum refert: 81 caluescit‚ ut uidi, cum adultior
est. Turnerus Aristotelis coruum aquaticum 81 Plinij phala-
crocoracem, 81 coruum syluaticum nostrum auem unam esse
arbitratur, tertium genus graculi. Coruus syluaticus Helue-
tiorum, inqust, auis est corpore longo et ciconia paulo minore,
cruribus breuibus, sed crassis: rostro rutilo, parum adunco

Doubtless Turner’s work is not free from errors, as in the
case of the very old story of the breeding of t‘he Bernicle-Goose
(which, however, he was most loth to credit even when assured
of its truth by an Irish Divine), in his confounding of the
onocrotalus with the Ardea stellaris and the Cornish with
the Alpine Chough; yet these are but small blots on a very
excellent treatise, which compares most favourably with other
writings of his time.

It is quite evident from various passages that Turner was
acquainted with Aristotle’s works in the original Greek, and
especially with his Hz‘story of slm'mczls3 but he preferred
quoting that author from the Latin translation of Theodorus
