Α εεζρίίνες 1 7

PLINv.

Of Accipitres we have found sixteen kinds. Circus
among them, halting in a foot, of lucky omen in
nuptial affairs and money business. Triorches next,
to which Phoemone¹ gave the foremost place in
auspices, named from the number of its testicles:
the Romans call it Buteo and the Greeks AEsalon:¹
it is the only kind which may be seen at every time.
The rest leave us in winter. An Accipiter that flies
by night is called Cymindis; it is rarely found in
woodlands, in the day it scarce can see: it wages
deadly warfare with the Aquila, and they are often
captured clinging to each other. So far Pliny.

Though Aristotle may set forth that there are ten kinds
of Accipstres, and Pliny that there are sixteen, yet neither
of them has distinguished or described the kinds so that it
may be easy for a reader to apply to each its proper name
from their accounts So no one can in fairness claim from
me their exact difference, nor yet the British or the German
name of each, together with the Latin or the Greek equivalent.
Ι will, however, surely not conceal from you, my reader‚
what I think to be the British name, and to which Latin
name it ought to be applied.

Buteo, called in Greek τριόρχης, if I do not err, is the
Buzzard of the English, for it is compared with Milvus as
to size3 moreover it is seen at all times, and is such a bird
as Aristotle makes his Buteo in the eighth book of the
‘History of Animals.'

Αἰσάλων, since in Pliny’s judgment it appears at every
season‚ and among the smaller Hawks the Merlin or the
Smerl alone seems to appear2 at all times, is, I think, the
Merlin of the English and Smerl of the Germans.

, ¹ Phoemone, called ‘Daughter of Apollo,' was a priestess at Delphi.

oversight.
