“Of the Goose kind there are Penelopes and
also Chenalopeces, the latter generally smaller than
a Goose; and Britain knows no richer feast than

these.''

The second runs 1——

“Of the Goose kind are Chenalopeces and Che-

nerotes, Britain knows no richer feast than these.''

To me the latter reading most approves itself, for it
both makes us richer by one bird, and the Penelopes seem
to our learned men to be of the Duck tribe rather than of
the Goose. But Ι will try to say what these birds are and
by what names they go among our countrymen. The Chena-
lopex1 takes its name from the Goose and the Fox, while
it is called by Gaza Vulpanser in Latin, though our people
nowadays name it Bergander². It is longer than a Duck
and bigger, with a ruddy breast. It lives upon the waters
and in coneys' burrows. At times it even nests in holes of
lofty rocks (whence possibly the name was first allotted to
it by our ancestors the Anglo-Saxons). I have nowhere else
seen the Vulpanser save upon the river Thames. Neverthe-
less they say that it is plentiful upon the isle which is called
Tenia³, and that it brceds in coneys' burrows there. In
habits it is very like a Fox, for, while the young are still
of tender age, should any 0116 attempt to capture them, the
old Vulpanser rolls upon the ground before his very feet&
as if she could be taken there and then, and thus allures
the man to follow her, until the young are able to escape;
then she flies off and summons back her brood. I think that
there are very few men now who know what sort of birds the

¹ Turner’s bird was undoubtedly the Sheld-Drake (Tadorna cornuta),
notwithstanding the fact that the name Chcmzlopex has been conferred
on the so-called ‘Fox-Goose' of Africa.

2 The Sheld-Drake is still the Bargander or Bergander of some
districts of England ; possibly the correct spelling should be Burgander,
i.e. Burrow Duck. The word seems to have nothing to do with Berg=a
mountain.

3 Possibly St Mary's, or even Coquet Island.

4 The Sheld-Drake does not usually behave thus.
