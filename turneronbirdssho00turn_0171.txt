Pica 1 4 5

ordinary sort, though not considerable to the eye: sor
them it is enough honour to have a kind of human
speech. ·However people deny that others are able to
learn, save those belonging to the group which lives
on acorns——and os these again those with the greatest
ease which have five toes upon each of their feet: nor
even they except during the first two years of life.
Of late, however, and as yet infrequently‚ towards
the city from the Appennines there have begun to be
observed some sorts of Picae which being remarkable
for the length of their tails have been called “varice''
They have this special mark that they grow bald in
every year when rape is sown.

Of Picae Pliny seems to make two kinds: this latter kind
os his would seem to be that Pie which here and there in
Germany and England plunders both the eggs and chicks of
fowls, possessing a long tail. Ι do not know another kind of
l’ie provided with a tail so long as this. And furthermore
our common Pie is wont to grow bald every year. Now
what the second sort of Pie might be I doubted very long,
nor have Ι yet grasped it sufficiently. But when Ι was in
Italy upon the banks of the Po, and while my sellow-
travellers and Ι were walking out, a certain bird like a
Pie, in English called a Jay, in German mercolphus, offered
itself conveniently for observation. Thereupon Ι asked a
certain monk, who then by chance was present, its Italian
name, and he replied to me that it was called the Seed Pie1.
When therefore I perceived that with the common people of
Italy not only patent traces of the old Roman tongue still
actually existed, but also of things scientific, a suspicion
rose within me that this bird was of the group of l'ies;
moreover, since I knew that the same imitated human tones
much more correctly than the other Pie, which is the commoner,
so much was I confirmed in my suspicion that l can scarcely
refuse to credit that this Pie was Pliny's second kind, par-
ticularly as it lives on acorns more than any other bird.

¹ Ghiandaja is the modern Italian name, derived from 'glans⁷=an
acorn.
