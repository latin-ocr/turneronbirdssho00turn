Me7sgns--Merops ι ι 3

Herons¹. Such as make their nests on sea-clifss generally
live on prey from the sea, but such as breed on trees seek
rivers, lakes, and streams to get their food.

OF Tm: Mmoffi FROM ARISTOTLE.

There are some who insist that Meropes foster
the old age of their parents and thus take their turn,
so that the parents not in age alone are nourished
by the labour of their offspring, but as soon as power
is given to these: that neither does the mother-bird
fare forth nor yet the father, but they stay within
a resting place and are fed by the aid of those which
they themselves have bred, nourished and reared.
The plumage of this bird is pale beneath, but blue
above like that in Halcyon: the pinnules at the end
of the wings are reckoned red. It lays six or seven
eggs in summer in the softer bankS‚ and makes its
nurseries by boring into these for quite four cubits,
and it also uses hollows in the soil.

PLINv.

Nor truly is less skill shewn by those birds which
make their nurseries in the soil, since the weight of
their bodies hinders them from mounting to a height.
The kind called Merops feeds its parents in retreat:
the colour of its feathers underneath is pale, the upper

surface blue‚ the former being somewhat red. It
breeds within a hole, bored out six feet in depth.

In fairness I admit that Ι have never seen the Merops,
nor have I met anyone who ever saw it. Stil] I am not
unaware that there are not unlearned schoolmasters among
the Germans, who would teach us that their grunspecht is
the Merops, though against the sense of Aristotle and Pliny.
