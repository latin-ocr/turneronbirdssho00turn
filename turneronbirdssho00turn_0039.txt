Of the ten kinds of Accipitres

ARISTOTLE.

HE chief kind of Accipitres is Buteo, which from

the number of its testicles is named Triorcha‚
AEsalo is the second, Circus is the third. Again
Stellaris, palumbarius, and Pernix differ. Those which
have more breadth are called Subuteones ; other kinds
are named Percae and Fringillarii; others Lceves and
Rubetarii‚ which get their living most easily, and fly
near to the ground. Some have asserted that there
are no fewer than ten kinds of the Accipitres which
differ from each other in their several modes of
hunting. For some sorts seize a Dove when sitting
on the ground, but do not touch one flying; others
seek their prey when perched upon a tree, or'such
like, but if it be on the ground or flying do not attack
it. And others seize it neither on the ground, nor
when resting alost, but strive to catch it flying.
Moreover it is said that each kind of Accipitres is
recognised by Doves. So, when the Accipiter comes
forth, if it be such as hunts on high, they stay where
they have settled, but, if that which comes be such

as takes them on the ground, they stay not, but forth-
with fly off.
