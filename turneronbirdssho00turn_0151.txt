Onocrolalns 1 2 5

Now in a few words Ι will portray to you that bird
which they assert to be the Onocrotalus. In general make
of body it is like the Heron, with long legs, though shorter
than that bird’S. The neck is long and marvellously thick
with plumeS. the beak is neither short nor blunt. Very black
seathers clothe the head, but on the body generally they
are dusky and pale, and most thickly sprinkled with black
spots. It has very long feet, indeed there is a span‘s length
from the claw-tips of the middle toe of either soot to the
heel of the same. It has very long claws, for that which
serves in birds the purpose of a heel exceeds an inch and
a half in length, on which account our countrymen use it to
pick their teeth, and mount it in silver. The middle toe
os either foot, which is longer than the rest, has a prodigious
claw, that is to say, toothed and serrated, not unlike the
shells of little scallops are, doubtless contrived by nature
to retain the slippery 6615, which the bird catches. The tail
is very short, the gullet most capaciouS, and it uses it in the
place of a crop. It has a belly not like that of other birds,
but like that of a dog3 it also is large and capacious.
But lest what I have written thus far of this bird seem
false to amyone, or lest I seem to have learnt the above
from the reports of others rather than from sure experience:
while the first pages of this book were still at preSS‚ and
while I was examining the bird and was dissecting it, and
taking note whether it really had a belly and a stomach
such as Pliny had assigned to it, there were assisting me
Joannes Echthius, a very learned man and a most zealous
student of the more abstruse secrets of nature, a physician
much renowned among the men of Cullen: Cornelius
Sittardus decorated with the highest laurel-wreath of Medi-
cine: Marcus Lubertus Estius‚ professor of the liberal arts,
both excellently skilled in that of simpling, and wonderfully
earnest, and as well as these Conradus EmbecanuS‚ a man
well-informed in no common degree, and a remarkablycareful
corrector in the printing-house of Gymnicus, with certain
others versed in learned arts, who can and will bear witness
to the fact that I have written nothing here about this bird
which 1 have not observed in company with all of them.
It sits about the sides of lakes and marshes, where putting
