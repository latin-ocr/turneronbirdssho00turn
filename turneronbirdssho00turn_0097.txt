a Daker Hen, and the Germans eyn schryk1. Ι have not seen or
heard it anywhere in England, save in Northumberland alone.

OF THE Avi-ss DIOMEDEAE FROM PLINV.

And I will not omit the birds of Diomede2, which
Juba calls Cataractae, telling us that they have
teeth and fire-coloured eyes, but otherwise are white.
They always have two captainS‚ one to lead the
band, the other to bring up the rear. These birds
dig furrows with the beak, then cover them with
wattlework, and hide this with the earth thrown out
at first; in these places they breed. Each furrow
has two openings, one facing east, by which they
may go out towards their feeding grounds, the other
facing west, by which they rnay return. They always
ssutter out to disburden the belly, and against the
wind. In one place only of the whole world are they
to be seen, naniely that island which we have set
down as famous for the tomb and shrine of Diomede,
over against the shore of Apulia. They are like
Fulicae. Strangers who come there they attack with
clamour‚ only on the Greeks they fawn, with wonderful
discernment, paying as it were this tribute to the race
of Diomede, and every day they purify his shrine
with brirnrning throats and water-laden wings.

OF THE FICEDULA.

¹ Schlegel (Vog. Nederl. 11. 60) says that the Dutch schriek is the
&Vater Rail (Rullus aquaticus), but Turner evidently means the Corn
Crake (Crex pratensis). Naumann (zVatusg. νίζε. Deulsclzl. IX. p. 496)
gives Schrecke as a local name sor the Corn Crake.

2 Apparently Shearwaters of some species are meant. For the story
see any work on Mythology.
