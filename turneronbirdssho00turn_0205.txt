Wherefore Herodotus, the father of the rhetorician
Briso, thought that Vultures winged it from some
other world unknown to uS, his argument being that
nobody had ever seen a Vulture's nest, although a multi-
tude at once come into sight when following an army.
And yet. however difficult it be to See the nest of this
bird, still it has been seen at certain times, Vultures
lay two eggs each. Resides it is a well-known fact that
animals which feed on flesh do not breed more than

once a year.

PLINY.

Of Vultures the black are most plentiful. No one
has ever reached their nests and therefore there have
been some who erroneously thought that they flew
hither from another world. They 'really nest in very
lofty rocks. Indeed the offspring‚ generally twins,
are often seen. Umbricius, the most skilful augur
of our age, asserta that they lay three eggs, with
one of which they cleanse the others and purify the
nest, and afterwards throw it away. And that they
fly three or two days beforehand to a place where
carcases are likely to be found.

Quite wrongly certain scholars call the Vulture Gryps,
confounding foolishly thc Vulture and thc Gryps, since thc
Gryps is a Gryphon, or an animal believed to be both winged
and quadruped.
