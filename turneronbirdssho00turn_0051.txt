Chenerotes are. And, though I am a Briton, I am not quite
sure about our Chenerotes3 for as yet, apart from the two
kinds that Aristotle gives, I know two sorts of Gcese in
Britain and will frankly own that, if the Chenerotes are not
to belong to either of them, they are quite unknown to me.
The first Goose by our people nowadays is called the Brant
and Bernicle‚ and is a smaller bird than the Wild Goose‚ with
the breast partly black. The rest is ashen grey. It flies,
gabblcS, haunts swamps, and devastates green crops‚ like the
Wild Goose. Its flesh is somewhat strong, and is the less
sought after by the rich. No one has seen the Bernicle's
nest or egg, nor is this wonderful, since Bernicles without
a parent's aid are said to have spontaneous generation in
this way: When after a certain time the firwood masts or
planks or yard-arms ofa ship have rotted on the sea, then fungi,
as it were, break out upon them first, in which in course of
time one may discern evident forms of birds, which afterwards
are clothed with feathers, and at last become alive and fly.
Now lest this should seem fabulous to amyone, besides the
common evidence of all the long-shore men of England‚
Ireland, and Scotland, that renowned historian Gyraldus1‚
who composed a history of Ireland in much more happy
style than could have been expected in his time, bears witness
that the generation of the Bernicles is none other than this.
But inasmuch as it seemed hardly safe to trust the vulgar and
by reason of the rarity of the thing I did not quite credit
Gyraldus‚ while I thought on this, of which I now am
writing‚ I took counsel of a certain man, whose upright
conduct, often proved by me, had justified my trust, a theo-
logian by profession and an Irishman by birth, Octavian by
name, whether he thought Gyraldus worthy of belief in this
affair. Who, taking oath upon the very Gospel which he
taught, answered that what Gyraldus had reported of the
generation of this bird was absolutely true, and that with
his own eyes he had beholden young, as yet but rudely
formed, and also handled them, and, if Ι were to stay in
London for a month or two, that he would take care that
some growing chicks should be brought in to me. This
curious generation of the Bernicle will not appear so very
