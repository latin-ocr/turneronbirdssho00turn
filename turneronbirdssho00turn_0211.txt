PERORATION To THE READER.

HERE perhaps will not be wanting those who

will attribute this to me as a fault, that this little
book of mine contains within it many more conjectures
than sure statements : to whom Ι reply, that it seemed
to me much more prudent and becoming on a subject
that is difficult and not yet sufficiently explored to
tread doubtingly and modestly by conjecture, and so to
enquire, than to pronounce rashly and immodestly on
things undetermined. Moreover that I have written
nothing here of the habits and medicina] nature of
birds, Ι have for reasons the unsuitability of the time
of year and its brief span (for the whole book was
written in a space of less than two months) and a
supply of money too slender to suffice for the per-
fection osa work of that kind. For who without great
command of money can set off for distant regions,
to observe the forms and habits of foreign birds, and
there to stay a long time for that purpose? Who,
hindered by his household or his calling or other
business from going abroad could without vast expense
give heed to all the kinds of birds brought to him
by fowlers from the various quarters of the world?
and when brought, who would be capable without
vast expense of keeping them in vivaria and cages,
that he might investigate their habits to the full?
